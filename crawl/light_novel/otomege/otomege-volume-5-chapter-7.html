<h1>Chapter 7 – Collar</h1>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p>Clement came to the Noelle and Lelia’s apartment.</p>
<p>Clement was an instructor in the academy. He was muscular, and yet he was wearing makeup.</p>
<p>He was wearing a very tight shirt that displayed the shape of his muscles very clearly. He was a tall male instructor who talked like a woman.</p>
<p>But, in reality he was a knight who was serving Lespinasse House.</p>
<p>He was protecting Noelle and Lelia from the shadow in the academy.</p>
<p>Noelle and Lelia were able to enroll into the academy was thanks to the endeavor of the former retainers of Lespinasse House.</p>
<p>「Lelia-sama──Noelle-sama was, taken into the custody of Barriere House.」</p>
<p>Clement reported that with a pale face and grieving expression.</p>
<p>Lelia wasn’t really panicking because she already knew about it.</p>
<p>「I see.」</p>
<p>「──You aren’t surprised?」</p>
<p>Clement usually talked like a woman, but now he was talking like a man because this was a serious talk.</p>
<p>Lelia felt a discomfort from that, but this wasn’t the time to talk about it.</p>
<p>Lelia was calm inside her heart.</p>
<p>(With how Loic is doing right now, big sis too will surely be able to accept him. In the first place, it’s a mistake that such man was chosen as the guardian.)</p>
<p>Noelle’s partner wasn’t Leon. ──It was Loic.</p>
<p>That was the correct scenario.</p>
<p>「I know that all of you have been protecting us. Thanks to everyone we were also able to enroll into the academy without any problem. It was also──thanks to Clement-sensei taking care of us.」</p>
<p>Clement kneeled in front of Lelia.</p>
<p>Clement had always been worried for the two of them.</p>
<p>He would sometimes come to the apartment to check on them. He would also back them up indirectly in the academy.</p>
<p>「So you have realized.」</p>
<p>「It’s obvious if you just think a little about it. ──Well, big sis didn’t notice though.」</p>
<p>「It seems so.」</p>
<p>Clement had felt it somehow that Noelle didn’t notice about him.</p>
<p>Lelia was aware because she had the knowledge from that otome game.</p>
<p>The main character came from Lespinasse House, the house that was at the top of the seven great nobles.</p>
<p>The former retainers of that house were supporting the main character.</p>
<p>「However, it’s unexpected that Noelle-sama is the one chosen as the priestess.」</p>
<p>「Unexpected?」</p>
<p>Lelia tilted her head at Clement’s words.</p>
<p>「Why? Both Okaa-sama and Otou-sama said that I don’t have the aptitude for it.」</p>
<p>Clement was bewildered.</p>
<p>「N-no. It was just my feeling, that if someone is going to be chosen as the priestess, then it surely would be Lelia-sama. I’m not aware at all about this aptitude matter. After all I was at the bottom rank among the knights who served Lespinasse House at that time.」</p>
<p>Lelia sighed.</p>
<p>「Big sis is the priestess. And, what are you all going to do now?」</p>
<p>「Lelia-sama’s safety is more important right now rather than us. We don’t know how Barriere House will move. Anyway, let’s evacuate from this place right away.」</p>
<p>It seemed Clement was planning to shelter Lelia.</p>
<p>But Lelia wasn’t panicking.</p>
<p>She already knew what would happen from the beginning.</p>
<p>「It’ll be fine. Emile will come to pick me up.」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>The outside became noisy.</p>
<p>Clement carefully took a peek outside. There he found several cars with the family crest of Pleven House parked outside.</p>
<p>The knights of Pleven House wearing ceremonial outfit appeared with Emile in suited figure behind them.</p>
<p>「Emile-kun?」</p>
<p>Clement gasped and turned her gaze to Lelia.</p>
<p>Lelia said.</p>
<p>「Do you want to come too? I’ll be in Emile’s care for now.」</p>
<p>Clement had to inform the people related to Lespinasse House at the academy about the situation.</p>
<p>Here Lelia was finally feeling relieved that the scenario was progressing on the right track.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p>Marie was in great panic.</p>
<p>(Gyaaaa!! Noelle is taken away while big bro isn’t here──I-I’m going to get killedddddd!!)</p>
<p>Noelle was taken away by Loic.</p>
<p>However she never thought that Loic would come to take away Noelle with no concern of any consequence.</p>
<p>It was difficult even for Marie to choose to resist to the bitter end at that time.</p>
<p>Creare was watching Marie writhing around while hodling her head.</p>
<p>『I never get bored watching Marie-chan. I like you Marie-chan.』</p>
<p>「Why yes thank you! More importantly, why didn’t you tell me quicker that we were going to get surrounded!? Even though we could escape if Loic came attacking! I would be able to run around with Noelle before that happened!」</p>
<p>Creare corrected Marie’s thinking.</p>
<p>『They had also sent soldiers to the harbor. I thought it was strange that the number of guardships that are watching over Licorne was increasing recently. So it was actually a preparation for this.』</p>
<p>「Tell me something like that if you noticed! Are you going to apologize together with me if big bro get angry!? That’s the important thing!」</p>
<p>『How you immediately jumped at your own self-protection is just great! ──Well, to be honest, I think there wouldn’t be anything else that could be done except handing over Noelle even if master is here.』</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>Creare was eavesdropping at the conversation between Loic and Noelle.</p>
<p>『Even I was gathering information at least. It was true that they aimed at the timing while master is absent, but it was only a matter of time before they made a move.』</p>
<p>「As I thought it was because big bro isn’t here!」</p>
<p>『Aa~, that’s not it. That boy called Loic was targeting Noelle-chan. But you see, the six great nobles have other intention. It looks like Barriere House is attempting to oust Rault House.』</p>
<p>Marie was troubled when a political topic came up.</p>
<p>「──Heh?」</p>
<p>『That <em>I don’t get it</em> face is nice! Well, in short, it’s an internal strife within the commonwealth. It’ll surely happen even if master is here. Even so, that Loic boy is also amazing. He negotiated with Noelle-chan using themselves as hostage.』</p>
<p>Marie looked creeped when she heard how Loic threatened Noelle that they would fight to the last man.</p>
<p>「That’s not the capture target I know in the otome game.」</p>
<p>She thought that Loic would be someone cooler, but his action was just totally uncool.</p>
<p>『Even master would back off when faced with that Loic’s attitude. That’s why, Marie-chan don’t need to be that worried. Rather, isn’t this just like the scenario that Marie-chan and master mentioned? It’ll be happy end if Noelle-chan get together with Loic. ──Except for Noelle-chan that is.』</p>
<p>Marie looked down.</p>
<p>「──But I want Noelle to be happy too.」</p>
<p>Creare denied that.</p>
<p>『That’s nothing but impossible. In the current situation it’s difficult for everyone’s happiness and that girl’s happiness to be realized together.』</p>
<p>Marie recalled the time Noelle was living together with them. It made her hated herself who was unable to do anything.</p>
<p>It was then a carefree voice came from the entrance.</p>
<p>「I’m back~. Everyone, I’m bringing souvenirs too!」</p>
<p>──It was Leon’s voice.</p>
<p>Creare was excited.</p>
<p>『Ah, master has returned. Master!』</p>
<p>She literally flew away in order to meet Leon.</p>
<p>Marie gritted her teeth.</p>
<p>(You’re too late!)</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p>Cordelia-san’s expression was twitching when we returned to Marie’s mansion.</p>
<p>「What is this mansion? It’s not looked after at all.」</p>
<p>It looked like she couldn’t bear it as a maid.</p>
<p>Kyle who came down from the stairs objected to those words.</p>
<p>「I wish you give us words of praise instead for maintaining a mansion this large with so few people. Besides──」</p>
<p>A cheeky attitude despite being just a kid.</p>
<p>The one who interrupted those words of Kyle was Yumeria-san who put down her bag and leaped at him.</p>
<p>「Kyle!」</p>
<p>「Ka-kaa-san!?」</p>
<p>It was a moving reunion between parent and child.</p>
<p>I shed a tear.</p>
<p>Cordelia-san also read the mood and stayed quiet.</p>
<p>「Kyle, you see! I’m also going to work over here to take care of the coun──Leon-sama. We can be together now!」</p>
<p>Yumeria-san looked happy, but Kyle immediately tore her away from himself.</p>
<p>He was making a very displeased face, but his ears were red.</p>
<p>「I-I’m in the middle of work! Besides, why is Kaa-san coming to other country like this. They should send other people here.」</p>
<p>Yumeria-san was shocked to hear that.</p>
<p>「──Kyle, do you hate it that I’m here?」</p>
<p>Kyle kept sending glances at me and Cordelia-san. It was obvious that he was bothered with our presence.</p>
<p>This kid was at that age.</p>
<p>「I-I don’t hate it or anything, it’s just I’m in the middle of working! Don’t bring private matter into work!」</p>
<p>What professional spirit.</p>
<p>But Yumeria-san was dejected because she took Kyle’s words seriously, so I tried to patch things up.</p>
<p>「Kyle, I understand that you’re at the age of puberty, but be kinder to her. No one here is going to say anything even if you mix private and work matter a bit. Come on, leap onto Yumeria-san’s chest.」</p>
<p>Kyle’s face went red at my words.</p>
<p>「You’re also in puberty!」</p>
<p>Stupid. This was my second life.</p>
<p>There wasn’t any puberty at the second life.</p>
<p>「Don’t group me together with you. I’m an adult.」</p>
<p>「Liar!」</p>
<p>Luxion who was floating beside me muttered an insult.</p>
<p>『It’s like master is always in puberty though.』</p>
<p>「Oi!」</p>
<p>This AI, he wasn’t kind at all to his master.</p>
<p>Creare came flying while we were making a ruckus at the entrance.</p>
<p>『Master, welcome back~』</p>
<p>「I’m back. More importantly, has anything happened?」</p>
<p>When I asked whether there was anything that happened while I wasn’t here, Creare spoke with a tone like nothing particular had happened.</p>
<p>『Let’s see. At most there is only the matter of Noelle getting taken away by Barriere House I guess? Ah, master brought souvenirs right? Marie-chan will be happy for that. She is going to say, precious sugar content get, or something like that.』</p>
<p><em>I see, so Noelle was taken away~</em>, I muttered before I came to my senses.</p>
<p>「You, that’s really important thing ain’t it!?」</p>
<p>And then I noticed.</p>
<p>The mansion was too quiet.</p>
<p>「Eh? Where are Julius and others? What are those guys doing at this emergency?」</p>
<p>Those guys, they were normally useless so they should work at this kind time at least──while I was thinking that, Marie appeared drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p>「Oi, what happened?」</p>
<p>「──I, I chased them out.」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>Marie yelled.</p>
<p>「I chased them out! They wouldn’t help even when it’s summer vacation, and they even used up the living expenses as they pleased! They bought useless things like flower bouquets! What’s more they bought tons of them──do you know how tiresome it was to throw all those flowers out」</p>
<p>She was muttering complains at the latter half. So this girl chased out Julius and others huh.</p>
<p>「A-are they doing okay out there?」</p>
<p>Creare was laughing.</p>
<p>『They’re fine. I’m properly monitoring them. Then does master want to watch their activity later? It’ll be worth it.』</p>
<p>「It’s fine if they’re alright.」</p>
<p>Well, I could understand Marie’s feeling that wanted to kick them out, and it would be better for those guys to learn about the society a bit.</p>
<p>Even so, those guys were really useless.</p>
<p>Were they really capture targets of an otome game?</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p>I entered an unused room in order to hear more about the situation from Marie and Creare.</p>
<p>It would be troubling if other people listened to this talk.</p>
<p>『──And that was what happened. Loic threatened Noelle-chan to be his using the commonwealth’s soldiers as hostage.』</p>
<p>「He went that far?」</p>
<p>Although there was a problem with the timing, Noelle getting chosen as the priestess was within our expectation.</p>
<p>However, Loic’s action had crossed the limit.</p>
<p>What the hell was he thinking, using the lives of so many people as shield?</p>
<p>『Ah, please don’t blame Marie-chan. Even master would only be able to watch if you were there.』</p>
<p>I looked at Marie who was curling behind Creare. I thought that it would be better to think of a solution first before blaming her, so I switched my feeling.</p>
<p>But, I wanted to say one thing.</p>
<p>「If it was me then I would stop Noelle at any cost.」</p>
<p>『──I think, Noelle-chan would still go with Loic even if master was there.』</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>Marie was hiding behind Creare, but she was still completely visible.</p>
<p>Even with her small build, it was impossible for Marie to hide behind such small round body.</p>
<p>「You’re dense big bro.」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>When I smiled at her, Marie shrieked 「Hih!」 in fear.</p>
<p>Luxion shook his red eye side to side in exasperation. Then he turned toward me.</p>
<p>『Master, what’re we going to do? Will we fight the commonwealth, or will we just watch and leave things to the flow of event──it’s master’s decision.』</p>
<p>It seemed Creare had gathered information in Alzer.</p>
<p>『It looks like Barriere House will make Noelle-chan marry with Loic at this rate. Perhaps they’re aiming for the position of the next guardian?』</p>
<p>I noticed one thing there.</p>
<p>「Wait a second? The priestess’s crest that Noelle have──where did it come from?」</p>
<p>Did it come from sapling-chan, or from the sacred tree──wouldn’t it be better to ascertain who she was chosen by?</p>
<p>All gazes gathered on Creare. She then said <em>Tehe!</em></p>
<p>『From the sapling perhaps? The data is too few so I can’t determine it.』</p>
<p>「You, that’s the important part!」</p>
<p>Then Luxion specified the answer.</p>
<p>『There is no problem. The sapling is the one who chose Noelle.』</p>
<p>Marie was surprised.</p>
<p>「Eh? How do you know that?」</p>
<p>Luxion didn’t answer.</p>
<p>He asked me a question.</p>
<p>『It will be master’s decision from here. Noelle’s situation right now can be said to be on the correct path based on the game scenario. Even so, will master still get involved with Noelle?』</p>
<p>Was there any need for us to get involved even though things were progressing just like the scenario?</p>
<p>I spoke jokingly.</p>
<p>「Are you an idiot? If Noelle was forcefully taken away, that means it’s not following the scenario. Rather, it’s a bad end. This is the wrong path, isn’t it? ──I’ll take Noelle back. In the worst case I’ll even take her back to the kingdom temporarily to escape.」</p>
<p>『So master is going to save her in the end.』</p>
<p>That bastard Loic was no good.</p>
<p>That guy wasn’t worthy for Noelle.</p>
<p>Marie was about to say something, but then she closed her mouth.</p>
<p>And then Creare told me one more problem.</p>
<p>『Ah, setting that aside, Louise of Rault House has gotten engaged with Hughes of Druille House. Master, you are close with Louise aren’t you? Is it alright that you don’t congratulate her?』</p>
<p>──The events that happened while I wasn’t here were too many.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p>「That good-for-nothing──he immediately stayed inside Marie’s room as soon as we arrived in Alzer.」</p>
<p>Cordelia who had changed into her maid uniform started cleaning her workplace that was in a dirty state.</p>
<p>Cordelia was aware that Leon and Marie were inside the same room.</p>
<p>Then she began calling Leon good-for-nothing.</p>
<p>Originally it was already hard to approve for even the two of them to stay under the same roof, and yet they even entered the same room. From Cordelia’s perspective, it was a betrayal toward Ange.</p>
<p>「I have to report this to Angelica-sama right away──hm?」</p>
<p>She looked at Yumeria who was cleaning together with her.</p>
<p>Yumeria was vacantly watching the transparent case on the dining room’s table that was filled with a plant.</p>
<p>「Yumeria-san, what’s the matter?」</p>
<p>Yumeria gasped in surprise when she was called out and then apologized.</p>
<p>「I-I’m sorry! Err, that──I’m curious with this child.」</p>
<p>Cordelia looked at the plant──the sapling that was put inside the case.</p>
<p>「It’s certainly strange. Isn’t it too plain to be used as a decoration? Is this the style in Alzer?」</p>
<p>She wanted to change the plant with something else right away, but she judged that she had to ask the mansion’s owner first.</p>
<p>「It’s too plain to be a decoration on the table, but it’ll also be troubling if a trouble is caused because we change it without permission. Let’s ask later.」</p>
<p>Cordelia was serious with her work.</p>
<p>But, Yumeria was in a strange state.</p>
<p>(Is she feeling down because her son acted cruel to her? It’ll be better to let her rest for a bit.)</p>
<p>Surely the cause of her state was Kyle’s cold reaction.</p>
<p>Cordelia concluded so and told Yumeria to rest.</p>
<p>「Yumeria-san, please go rest first if you are tired. I’ll take care of this place.」</p>
<p>「B-but」</p>
<p>「──Please talk with your son. There won’t even be any time to talk if it gets busy.」</p>
<p>「Y-yes!」</p>
<p>Yumeria left the room.</p>
<p>And then Cordelia recalled.</p>
<p>「Oh no! I won’t be able to investigate that good-for-nothing if I’m working here alone!」</p>
<p>Cordelia also couldn’t abandon her work. She resumed the cleaning with a frustrated face.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p>Yumeria went searching for Kyle, but she stopped walking at the corridor and looked around.</p>
<p>「Who?」</p>
<p>She felt like there was someone calling her in the empty corridor.</p>
<p>Normally she would get scared, but that voice was really──kind.</p>
<p>When she looked outside the window, she could see the sacred tree that was the symbol of Alzer.</p>
<p>It felt like she was seeing a mountain.</p>
<p>Yumeria went into a daze when she was watching the sacred tree.</p>
<p>「What is this. Something──」</p>
<p>She walked toward the window and got discovered by Kyle who was accidentally passing by.</p>
<p>「Kaa-san, are you skipping work?」</p>
<p>Yumeria saw her son’s exasperated face and made excuse in panic.</p>
<p>「Y-you see, someone was calling me!」</p>
<p>「There isn’t anyone here.」</p>
<p>Yumeria was also troubled of how to reply. She hung her head down in front of Kyle.</p>
<p>「Sorry.」</p>
<p>「Good grief. Let’s finish the cleaning quickly.」</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 7</h2>
<p>Albergue spontaneously stood up when he heard about Noelle.</p>
<p>He was in the middle of doing paperwork in the office of Rault House’s mansion.</p>
<p>「Impossible!」</p>
<p>The reason he yelled after hearing his subordinate’s report was because the priestess’s crest appeared on Noelle.</p>
<p>「Why does the priestess’s crest appeared on that child──no, I see」</p>
<p>He immediately noticed.</p>
<p>(I see. The sapling! In that case I can understand why that child is chosen. That girl was near where the sapling was.)</p>
<p>He knew that Noelle was staying in Leon’s mansion.</p>
<p>However Albergue never expected for the sapling to choose a priestess this quickly.</p>
<p>His subordinate continued his report.</p>
<p>「It seems Barriere House is going to hold a marriage ceremony between Noelle──no, the priestess and the next head of the house Loic-sama.」</p>
<p>「Marriage ceremony you say?」</p>
<p>Barriere House’s movement was too fast. He suspected that they might have known about this beforehand.</p>
<p>(Bellange doesn’t like that I’m in the position of acting chairman. Is he planning to take away the position from me with this?)</p>
<p>That would be troubling.</p>
<p>Albergue decided to consult with Fernand who he trusted in order to form a countermeasure right away.</p>
<p>「Contact Fernand.」</p>
<p>(Even so, a survivor of Lespinasse House is chosen as priestess──is this also destiny?)</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 8</h2>
<p>Noelle was confined in Barriere House’s mansion.</p>
<p>At the surface they said they were protecting her, but in reality the door was locked so she wouldn’t be able to escape.</p>
<p>There were also iron bars attached on the window. There were always guard standing outside the door and the window.</p>
<p>Noelle was sitting on the bed. She looked at Loic who came to the room.</p>
<p>Loic was holding a collar with a chain attached.</p>
<p>「This will be your engagement ring.」</p>
<p>「Are you insane?」</p>
<p>「Well, listen to me. This is a tool that was created with a part of the sacred tree in it. The collar is to be fixed on the servant, while this bracelet is to be worn by the master. With this, the person with the collar attached will become unable to escape from the master.」</p>
<p>The chain would vanish after both sides wore the set.</p>
<p>But, with this tool the two of them wouldn’t be able to separate from each other.</p>
<p>If she tried to escape forcibly, the chain would appear and the servant in the equation would be pulled toward the master forcefully.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to take off the collar after it was worn.</p>
<p>「How can such tool exist」</p>
<p>Noelle didn’t know.</p>
<p>「The usage of sacred tree is greatly advancing recently.」</p>
<p>「Hah! So you’re making use of the sacred tree. The sacred tree is really generous. After all it won’t take away the crests from you guys even when it’s used like this.」</p>
<p>Loic approached Noelle and grabbed her hair to pull her face closer.</p>
<p>「You won’t be able to escape anymore.」</p>
<p>Noelle glared at Loic.</p>
<p>「Do as you like. But, I absolutely won’t accept someone like you, someone who will sacrifice even a lot of lives just to get me alone.」</p>
<p>Loic laughed when he heard that.</p>
<p>「You’re stubborn like usual. I’m looking forward how long you’ll be able to keep that attitude. I’ll teach you thoroughly which of us is superior after we marry.」</p>
<p>Noelle’s eyes turned round like saucer in surprise when talk of marriage came up.</p>
<p>「M-marriage!?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, that’s right. It’s a ceremony to bind us together for eternity! It’ll also be an auspicious day where the priestess and guardian of Alzer comes back.」</p>
<p>Noelle averted her gaze from Loic.</p>
<p>「The guardian has to be chosen by the priestess. Besides, it has to be someone worthy.」</p>
<p>「I am worthy! I’m the next head of Barriere House, one of the six great nobles. I have the strength required to protect the sacred tree! Besides I love you. There isn’t anyone more worthy than me.」</p>
<p>Noelle looked at Loic.</p>
<p>「You’re really stupid. It’s the sacred tree’s sapling that chose me. The sacred tree that gave you your crest won’t recognize me. Too bad for you, Loic.」</p>
<p>Loic smiled toward Noelle.</p>
<p>「So what?」</p>
<p>「──Eh?」</p>
<p>「It doesn’t matter whether it’s the sacred tree or the sapling. If it’s the sacred tree then that’s fine. If it’s the sapling, the Barriere House will simply have to put it under our control. The Barriere House will lead this country as the top.」</p>
<p>「The sapling is with Leon──」</p>
<p>「The sacred tree’s sapling is going to choose its priestess and guardian. If an outsider is holding it, then we will just take it back whether with negotiation or with any kind of method. I wonder how much will that guy sell the sapling for? No, let’s negotiate directly with that guy’s country. The commonwealth will buy it no matter how much price they put on it.」</p>
<p>Loic asserted that they would take it back no matter what.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether Leon and others really understand correctly the true value of the sapling.</p>
<p>Besides, the existence of the priestess would be indispensable if they were going to use the sapling.</p>
<p>With Noelle under the control of the commonwealth, the kingdom didn’t have any way to make use of the sapling.</p>
<p>In that case there was a possibility they would use the sapling as negotiation material.</p>
<p>It was also fine even if the sapling was gone.</p>
<p>What Loic wanted was Noelle. What Bellange wanted was the seat of acting chairman.</p>
<p>「Noelle, you have nowhere to escape.」</p>
<p>Loic pushed down Noelle on the bed.</p>
<p>And then, he tried to put the collar on Noelle’s neck.</p>
<p>「L-let go!」</p>
<p>「Be obedient!」</p>
<p>Loic hit the resisting Noelle.</p>
<p>When Noelle stopped moving from the surprise, he placed the collar on her and wore the bracelet on his left arm.</p>
<p>Then the chain vanished just like Loic said.</p>
<p>Loic stared at his left arm, and then he kissed the bracelet.</p>
<p>Noelle didn’t move on top of the bed. Loic talked gently to her.</p>
<p>「It’s your fault for resisting, Noelle. But, don’t worry. If you listen to me, I’ll treat you kindly.」</p>
<p>Loic had a relieved expression, thinking that Noelle wouldn’t be able to escape with this.</p>
<p>He gently striked Noelle’s reddened cheek.</p>
<p>「I love you. That’s why Noelle, don’t make me angry. I don’t want to hit you.」</p>
<p>The door was knocked.</p>
<p>A voice called from outside.</p>
<p>『Loic-sama, there is a call from Fernand-sama.』</p>
<p>Loic clicked his tongue and separated from Noelle. And then he left the room.</p>
<p>Noelle was lying on the bed with her hands spread out and her hair disheveled.</p>
<p>When she touched the collar that was placed on her neck, tears spilled out.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 9</h2>
<p>It was shocking that I was thought as a man who could only charge from the front.</p>
<p>「To be honest, I’m more suited to secretly sneak around isn’t it?」</p>
<p>I was sneaking into the mansion of Barriere House──the place where Noelle was imprisoned.</p>
<p>Luxion had prepared a suit that used optical camouflage. It was like I was invisible when wearing it.</p>
<p>I stealthily slipped past the soldiers who were standing on guard.</p>
<p>Shoes that wouldn’t make any sound were really amazing.</p>
<p>Luxion was also melting into the surrounding scenery with me. He talked to me.</p>
<p>『Master, I have completely scanned this mansion. I have confirmed the room where Noelle is locked in.』</p>
<p>「Yosh, I’ll leave the navigation to you.」</p>
<p>『──Are you really planning to take her away?』</p>
<p>「It’s fine to save her if she is going to be forced into a marriage that she doesn’t want right?」</p>
<p>In fact, Loic was a dangerous guy.</p>
<p>『After you save her, what then?』</p>
<p>「I’ll evacuate her to the kingdom temporarily.」</p>
<p>『That’s not in the scenario.』</p>
<p>「It’s called being adaptable to the situation.」</p>
<p>Guards were patrolling the corridors.</p>
<p>There weren’t just servants inside. There were also armed soldiers. It made the atmosphere felt heavy.</p>
<p>『It’s not likely that Noelle will be able to choose the guardian even after she is rescued.』</p>
<p>「Why? Even Noelle is a girl. Of course she can fall in love.」</p>
<p>『Master is the guardian at the present time.』</p>
<p>「I won’t accept it. More importantly, can this crest get erased?」</p>
<p>Certainly the sapling had chosen me as the guardian.</p>
<p>But, the order was wrong like this.</p>
<p>It made me uneasy that it wasn’t following the scenario.</p>
<p>『It’s possible but──the condition to be chosen as guardian is having the strength to protect the sacred tree. I can’t believe that romance will be necessary for that.』</p>
<p>「It’s the sequel of “that otome game” with pink setting. The developer must not be thinking about the details too deeply.」</p>
<p>In the first place the romance factor was the main point of the game. Any other setting than that was just extra.</p>
<p>It was stupid to think too deeply about it.</p>
<p>『It’s no good to decide carelessly like that. Besides, there was a proper reason for why woman was placed above man at the kingdom.』</p>
<p>「Aa~, the reason for that was really terrible. I didn’t want to know something like that.」</p>
<p>Someone came so I stopped walking until the passed me. Luxion was going ahead just like I told him.</p>
<p>I could hear the conversation between the servants and soldiers. They let their guard down thinking that there wasn’t anybody else.</p>
<p>「The priestess will marry with our young master?」</p>
<p>「In that case, Loic-sama will be chosen as the guardian.」</p>
<p>「Barriere House will grow even more prosperous.」</p>
<p>I didn’t think that he would be chosen as the guardian though.</p>
<p>After all Noelle hated Loic.</p>
<p>The mansion was really big, but there were multiple soldiers standing guard over Noelle’s room.</p>
<p>Luxion said.</p>
<p>『There are two people in front of the door, but there are six people standing by in the neighboring rooms.』</p>
<p>「Then I’ll put all of them to sleep.」</p>
<p>I took out a handgun from my chest pocket. It had a silencer attached.</p>
<p>The bullets were magic bullets, befitting this fantasy world. It would put to sleep anyone who got hit with it.</p>
<p>「I’ll take care of the two in front of the door first.」</p>
<p>『Please be careful.』</p>
<p>I aimed the handgun and shot the guards.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 10</h2>
<p>Noelle was staring at the ceiling in a daze. It was then she heard the sound of people falling behind the door.</p>
<p>The soldiers standing by at the other rooms came out in panic. She could hear the noises from outside.</p>
<p>「Oi, what’s──hau!」</p>
<p>It seemed that man also collapsed when he was approaching the falling soldiers.</p>
<p>Noelle raised her upper body.</p>
<p>She was sweating.</p>
<p>(Could it be, Rault House is coming to kill me?)</p>
<p>She recalled that day──the day she escaped from the burning mansion. She could remember it even now.</p>
<p>The day Rault House destroyed Lespinasse House.</p>
<p>Surely they came to kill her after learning that she survived.</p>
<p>She heard the sounds of people falling while thinking of what to do.</p>
<p>The door then slowly opened. Noelle searched for anything that she could use as weapon.</p>
<p>However, there wasn’t anything like that here. Her captor had been careful to not put anything that could be used for that inside the room.</p>
<p>Entering the room was a man wearing all black from head to toe. She could only see his eyes.</p>
<p>But, Noelle immediately recognized him.</p>
<p>「Leon?」</p>
<p>She recognized him from his body shape and eyes──there was also the single eyed ball floating beside him.</p>
<p>Noelle felt just a little bit happy.</p>
<p>Leon took off the cloth mask he was wearing and held out his hand toward Noelle.</p>
<p>「Noelle, I come to pick you up. Let’s run away quickly. Wait, oi! What’s with that collar?」</p>
<p>「T-this is──」</p>
<p>「Well, it doesn’t matter. I’ll listen to the details later, for now let’s escape from here.」</p>
<p>Noelle lifted her hand to grab that hand but──she immediately withdrew her hand.</p>
<p>Leon looked puzzled.</p>
<p>「Noelle?」</p>
<p>Noelle recalled Loic’s words.</p>
<p>Loic who used a lot of people as hostage in order to obtain her.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what he would do if she escaped from here.</p>
<p>And then, it was Leon.</p>
<p>(I’ll be a bother for him if I stay at his side.)</p>
<p>He was a man who also had fiancées.</p>
<p>She couldn’t stay at his side and troubled him──she didn’t want to rely on him.</p>
<p>She wanted to forget him quickly.</p>
<p>Noelle looked at Leon’s face.</p>
<p>Her voice was trembling.</p>
<p>「Go, go back.」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>Noelle showed a resolute act toward the surprised Leon.</p>
<p>「I’m telling you go back! I’m the priestess of Alzer. Y-you──shouldn’t be involved with this. Don’t come to save me just because you feel like it. I am, here because of my own will.」</p>
<p>She said things that she didn’t even meant because she didn’t want to involve Leon in this.</p>
<p>(This just makes me feel wretched, so go home already.)</p>
<p>She fell in love with someone who already had fiancées, and on top of that she was going to be helped by him.</p>
<p>She was ashamed by herself who could only rely on others.</p>
<p>At the same time, she didn’t want to involve Leon further than this.</p>
<p>Noelle looked down.</p>
<p>「──Go back.」</p>
<p>Luxion didn’t say anything. Leon closed his mouth and then he left from the door he entered from.</p>
<p>Just before the door closed, Noelle lifted her face and her hand reached out.</p>
<p>She actually wanted to be saved.</p>
<p>She wanted to yell <em>save me </em>but──she immediately covered her mouth with her hands and sat on the floor.</p>
<p>Noelle cried when the door closed.</p>
<p>(This is──this is good. This is the correct thing to do. If I just endure, everything should be alright.)</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Leon doing things thoroughly… that’s certainly one way to percieve his actions. I’m fairly certain he’s just a whirlwind. He goes where he wants, he fucks everything up and then returns. He might not get everything done, and he doesn’t really understand where his own current takes him. He just arrives and then dissapears x.x</p>
