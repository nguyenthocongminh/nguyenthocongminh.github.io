<h1>Chapter 9 – Former Crown Prince</h1>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p>「I’m home.」</p>
<p>When Julius came back to the mansion after a total of one month, he was relieved from the bottom of his heart to see Marie again after so long.</p>
<p>At the same time, he saw the four who had prepared very lavish presents.</p>
<p>(I am──really pathetic.)</p>
<p>He realized just how useless he was after seeing the presents that the four prepared for Marie’s sake.</p>
<p>He was unable to earn a lot of money.</p>
<p>Marie approached him.</p>
<p>「Julius, why are you in such getup?」</p>
<p>Marie was worried for him.</p>
<p>He was happy just from that.</p>
<p>「──I was working in a stand.」</p>
<p>「A stand?」</p>
<p>Other than Marie there was also Kyle and Cara.</p>
<p>For some reason, Yumeria and──Cordelia who was working at Ange’s place were also here.</p>
<p>But, Julius paid them no attention and talked to Marie.</p>
<p>「Actually I planned to come here the first thing in the morning, but the boss had to replenish the stock at the morning so I was helping him.」</p>
<p>The boss had picked him up, that  was why Julius worked seriously.</p>
<p>But, it was just a part-time job in a food stand.</p>
<p>He couldn’t earn a lot of money there.</p>
<p>「It was a stand of meat skewer.」</p>
<p>「Julius was working part-time in a stand?」</p>
<p>Marie was surprised.</p>
<p>(Did I fail?)</p>
<p>But, this was his current self.</p>
<p>Also, Julius believed that his experience working in the stand wasn’t pointless.</p>
<p>He really had fun.</p>
<p>It was also painful.</p>
<p>He did his best working hard, but the money he earned was few. He learned how the society worked.</p>
<p>He listened to the complaints of the drunk customers, the boss scolded him because of his ignorance of the world──Julius learned just how wrong he was.</p>
<p>「Actually I wanted to buy a present but, I thought that perhaps this might actually be the best present.」</p>
<p>Julius held out his salary that he earned from this one month.</p>
<p>Marie accepted it.</p>
<p>It was an amount that couldn’t be said as a lot.</p>
<p>「Marie, this is the best that I can do. And then I have understood. I was──an idiot. I knew that money is something that has to be earned, but I didn’t comprehend it. There was this feeling inside me that money is surely just welling up from somewhere. I was able to understand that for the first time after trying to earn money by myself.」</p>
<p>「Julius.」</p>
<p>Marie hugged the brown envelope.</p>
<p>「I have no present to give you but, this is all the money that I can earn with everything I have. I want you to accept it.」</p>
<p>But, there were four people who were disappointed by this act of Julius.</p>
<p>「Your highness──I thought that you are a more capable person than this. It’s disappointing.」</p>
<p>Jilk who had high evaluation of Julius was looking really disappointed.</p>
<p>「I was secretly considering your highness as the most dangerous rival. This is a complete let-down.」</p>
<p><em>Is my rival only this much? </em>Brad’s slightly frustrated look expressed that.</p>
<p>「I don’t wanna see Julius looking like this.」</p>
<p>Greg expressed his sadness with his posing. He must have wished for the five of them to fight seriously. It seemed he didn’t want to see Julius being the only one dropping out.</p>
<p>「This is just a battle between four people like this.」</p>
<p>Chris was also vexed.</p>
<p>He seemed to think that Julius wasn’t worth to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Julius himself also understood that.</p>
<p>「I don’t have any word that I can say. This battle is my loss. But, I have given it everything I have in my own way. If this is the result than I can only accept it.」</p>
<p>It was frustrating, but Julius accepted that this was his current self.</p>
<p>It was frustrating that he couldn’t be Marie’s number one.</p>
<p>However, Julius who was unable to understand of his own worthlessness thought that it couldn’t be helped even if Marie chose someone else other than him.</p>
<p>Leon and others were watching him in astonishment.</p>
<p>Marie slowly approached Julius. She grabbed his right wrist and lifted it up.</p>
<p>「Julius, you are the number one!」</p>
<p>「──Eh?」</p>
<p>Jilk and others were dumbfounded because Julius who earned the least among them was called the number one.</p>
<p>「P-please wait, Marie-san! Isn’t this a match to choose the one who earn the most money?」</p>
<p>Marie fanned herself with the brown envelope while speaking to the four who didn’t understand anything.</p>
<p>「Oh? When did I say that I would choose the person who earned the most money? Setting that aside, even though I told you guys to go earn money, what kind of brain do you have there to waste money buying pointless things and ending up penniless huh! The amount of money that you four have earned is zero! That’s why your score is also zero.」</p>
<p>Brad’s shoulders slumped down.</p>
<p>A pigeon’s head peeked out from his pocket.</p>
<p>「How can this beeeee!!」</p>
<p>Greg fell on his knees.</p>
<p>「So we were mistaken?」</p>
<p>The men behind Greg consoled him. 「Greg-san, be strong!」「Your muscle is the best!」「Your pose is really striking!」 They said.</p>
<p>Chris apologized to Julius.</p>
<p>「So it’s his highness who snatched Marie’s heart. It’s our defeat.」</p>
<p>The four looked at Julius. They lost, but their faces were refreshed.</p>
<p>Julius looked at the four.</p>
<p>「Y-you guys──thank you」</p>
<p>The four consoled the crying Julius. At the side Marie was dancing with the brown enveloped raised high while chanting 「Salary! Salary!」.</p>
<p>Leon spoke last.</p>
<p>「What the hell is this?」</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p>The five idiots had returned.</p>
<p>That was nice and all, but the timing was iffy.</p>
<p>They weren’t present when Noelle was kidnapped, and now they were useless at this stage when they were going to take her back.</p>
<p>Just what was the meaning of these guys’ existence? I was seriously thinking that.</p>
<p>But, I also couldn’t possibly leave them in the dark.</p>
<p>After all, these were the bunch of idiots who returned as antique dealer, magician, bodybuilder, and festival guy after getting chased out and told to earn money.</p>
<p>The stand waiter Julius looked the most decent among them.</p>
<p>Julius was sitting on a chair and folding his arms while still wearing apron.</p>
<p>I had explained what had happened until now but──.</p>
<p>「I understand the gist of it. In other words, Bartfalt, you want to save Noelle right?」</p>
<p>「Yeah I guess.」</p>
<p>I didn’t expect any appropriate answer from these guys, but I guess I should ask for their opinion just in case.</p>
<p>If they said something stupid and tried to carry it out, they would have to be stopped.</p>
<p>I was thinking that.</p>
<p>「Then you can just save her.」</p>
<p>「Ha? You, did you listen to the story? Noelle is the priestess, that’s why Alzer desperately came to take her back. Even if I take her back to the kingdom and shelter her there, those guys are going to doubt us.」</p>
<p>As I thought these guys were hopeless.</p>
<p>Jilk tilted his head just while I was thinking that.</p>
<p>「Why is that no good?」</p>
<p>「N-no, that’s why, it’ll become international problem.」</p>
<p>Brad who was shuffling trump cards laughed when he heard the problem that I was worrying about.</p>
<p>「Of course it will. But, is that really that important?」</p>
<p>「Problem children like you guys won’t understand but, it’ll be a really big problem.」</p>
<p>Greg who wasn’t wearing any clothes except a single speedo pointed out at me.</p>
<p>Wear some clothes first you.</p>
<p>「This sacred tree’s sapling, it’ll be able to do the same thing like the sacred tree in the future right? Then, isn’t it only natural to take possession of it even if it will bring some problems with it? Even the palace will cover for you if it can solve the energy problem in the future.」</p>
<p>──Eh? This speedoman, is he unexpectedly bright?</p>
<p>Kyle offered some clothes to Chris, but he firmly refused 「This is my uniform」 and stayed in his current appearance of loincloth and happi coat.</p>
<p>「I can’t claim to be superior to the other four in politic, but after hearing the story just now I still don’t understand just what is it that is so worrying from it.」</p>
<p>He was looking at me with a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>「T-that’s why」</p>
<p>Even I was bewildered with these five denying my worry.</p>
<p>Julius spoke boldly.</p>
<p>「Bartfalt is concerned about the problem that will occur with the commonwealth, but I think the merit will outweigh such thing. That sacred tree’s sapling and the priestess being one set will also be more convenient for the kingdom right? In that case you can boldly steal her away with such just cause behind you.」</p>
<p>「You guys are really radical.」</p>
<p>「Not as much as Bartfalt though. In the first place. If you know about Noelle’s background, why didn’t you immediately evacuate her? The kingdom had a friendly relation with Lespinasse House. They will accept and shelter her even without counting the matter of the sapling.」</p>
<p>There’s the circumstance of that otome game! ──I couldn’t say that though.</p>
<p>「No, but, to kidnap her in this situation is a bit──the international problem it will cause is scary.」</p>
<p>「Enough already!」</p>
<p>While I was hesitating, Marie who was tightly grasping the brown envelope kicked my butt.</p>
<p>「Ouch! What the hell are you doing woman!」</p>
<p>「It’s irritating watching you. If you want to save her then just go save her! It’ll be troublesome if you keep worrying timidly forever and leave this alone until you miss the timing.」</p>
<p>I’m not being timid!</p>
<p>「There are many things that need to be considered like the responsibility for example!」</p>
<p>「You’re going to save her anyway right? If you’re just going to snap and rampage later, then it’s better to save her from the start. Aa~, you’re really irritating!」</p>
<p>Yumeria-san was panicking seeing me arguing with Marie.</p>
<p>And then, Cordelia-san sent a cold gaze toward me.</p>
<p>The five idiots formed a circle and talked in whispers.</p>
<p>「What do you think?」</p>
<p>「The worst I think.」</p>
<p>「How should I say it──horrible.」</p>
<p>「I also of the same opinion.」</p>
<p>「Is Bartfalt really not noticing?」</p>
<p>Julius and others were whispering between themselves, so I pointed at their way.</p>
<p>「You guys! Say it clearly if you got something to say!」</p>
<p>Then the five looked at each other and Julius stepped in front of me as their representative.</p>
<p>「Then let me say it Bartfalt──you didn’t notice Noelle’s feeling? Really?」</p>
<p>I lost my vigor from just now.</p>
<p>「Y-yeah.」</p>
<p>It was the fact that I didn’t notice until I was told. I couldn’t say anything back.</p>
<p>「I see. Well, that’s alright. Perhaps this problem could be avoided beforehand if you noticed, but that’s alright.」</p>
<p>This guy was really persistent.</p>
<p>He dare said that the problem wouldn’t become this big if only I noticed.</p>
<p>「By the way Bartfalt, do you remember when you dueled us the first time?」</p>
<p>「Obviously. It felt really refreshing that time.」</p>
<p>The five showed irritated expressions when I said that honestly.</p>
<p>I was a honest person, so I would answer honestly if I was asked a question.</p>
<p>「I see. Do you remember your words at that time? If my memory serves me right, it was about even though we have beautiful fiancées, we’re allowed to play around and so on wasn’t it? You were criticizing me for cheating.」</p>
<p>I also said something like that huh.</p>
<p>「What about it?」</p>
<p>「I’m just thinking that those words can be applied perfectly on you right now.」</p>
<p>「I’m not cheating like you guys.」</p>
<p>「It looks the same from outside though. ──But, I think you will be forgiven if it’s Angelica.」</p>
<p>「Ha?」</p>
<p>「I’m saying that if you say that you want to put Noelle beside you, Angelica will allow it. Angelica too is a noble’s daughter. What’s more she is a queen candidate who received a proper education. She will agree with securing Noelle if she that the national interest into consideration.」</p>
<p>「No way I can do that! You guys, are you telling me to cheat!?」</p>
<p>Jilk scoffed at my words.</p>
<p>「──You don’t have any persuasiveness even if you say that seeing that you already have two fiancées.」</p>
<p>What to do──I couldn’t say anything back.</p>
<p>Julius concluded the talk.</p>
<p>「Well, putting aside your personal feeling, the kingdom won’t oppose it if you save Noelle. Besides, you were given a position by mother so that you can move freely in the commonwealth right?」</p>
<p>Well, it was true that when I temporarily returned back home I was entrusted with the responsibility to take action in case anything happened here.</p>
<p>「I think I was given that kind of position.」</p>
<p>「Yosh, then there’s no problem. Go save Noelle.」</p>
<p>「──Eh?」</p>
<p>Chris who wasn’t joining the talk until now gave me an advice.</p>
<p>「Don’t worry. The commonwealth has been shutting themselves inside their own country for these last dozens of years. If the story about the sacred tree is true, those guys cannot invade other country. In the first place, it looks like all of their military are only for defense.」</p>
<p>The weapons of the commonwealth that was moving using the sacred tree’s energy was formidable in defensive aspect.</p>
<p>But, their weapons were weaker than the kingdom’s weapons when they came out of their territory.</p>
<p>「They’re going to complain a lot, but they won’t be able to actually do anything.」</p>
<p>I thought for a bit──and raised a problem.</p>
<p>「There is a possibility of Alzer applying a diplomatic pressure right?」</p>
<p>Brad answered that question.</p>
<p>「There is. But, you are forgetting one thing.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「If your story is true, this is a power struggle within Alzedr. Barriere House is only moving to obtain the authority. In that case, there is a house that is in trouble right now isn’t it?」</p>
<p>「You mean Rault House?」</p>
<p>「Correct. We can just join hand with Rault House in order to oppose Barriere House.」</p>
<p>Marie’s shoulders jumped when she heard that.</p>
<p>「S-say~, about that. Rault House’s reputation is bad isn’t it? I wonder if it’ll be alright for us to join hand with that kind of side without asking for permission first~」</p>
<p>Well, they were the last boss of that otome game’s sequel.</p>
<p>So to speak they were the villain in the game.</p>
<p>Greg argued against Marie’s opinion.</p>
<p>「You don’t get it huh, Marie. ──That’s only from Alzer’s perspective, right? From the kingdom’s perspective, it’ll be more convenient to have Rault House in control of Alzer. If we tell them that we’re going to take Noelle away in their situation, it feels like they will happily send us off!」</p>
<p>Certainly──from the perspective of Rault House that was thinking of Noelle’s existence as a thorn to their side, it wouldn’t hurt them at all even if the kingdom took her away.</p>
<p>Instead if that happened then Barriere House would be hindered from gaining prominence.</p>
<p>Jilk smiled while thinking of something bad.</p>
<p>「The kingdom will also be thankful if we can form a connection with Rault House that is the acting chairman.」</p>
<p>Julius put his hand on his waist and looked at me.</p>
<p>「Now then, Bartfalt──the problems are all cleared.」</p>
<p>「They ain’t cleared at all. We can’t obtain Rault House’s cooperation.」</p>
<p>「For that if you just──」</p>
<p>These guys, they were more capable than I thought.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, they were noble youths who had received proper upbringing.</p>
<p>I had forgotten it because they were usually too stupid, but they were honor students with excellent grades.</p>
<p>──You guys, don’t be serious only at this kind of time!</p>
<p>Cordelia-san had disappeared from the room without me noticing while I was having discussion with Julius and others.</p>
<p>And then she appeared once more.</p>
<p>「Leon-sama, there is a guest. He introduced himself as a messenger of Louise-sama from Rault House.」</p>
<p>「From Louise-san?」</p>
<p>Julius looked at me.</p>
<p>「Bartfalt, this is a chance! Get their cooperation no matter what.」</p>
<p>「Are you screwing with me?」</p>
<p>「No, I’m serious though?」</p>
<p>Don’t make it sound so easy!</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p>I entered the party venue of the six great nobles together with Marie.</p>
<p>I was wearing suit while Marie was wearing dress.</p>
<p>Normally I wouldn’t be invited here, but Louise-san prepared an invitation letter for me.</p>
<p>She designated this party venue as the place for us to meet.</p>
<p>It seemed she was unable to easily leave Druille House’s mansion. In addition I heard that she always had someone watching her.</p>
<p>She called us to this party venue to be able to meet us because Druille House’s movement was suspicious.</p>
<p>Marie’s eyes were stolen by the extravagant cooking.</p>
<p>「Aa~, that whole roast pig look delicious. I want to try eating it by myself.」</p>
<p>I was exasperated by Marie who said such thing.</p>
<p>「I’ll feed you that later so wait for now. We need to meet with Louise-san first.」</p>
<p>When we entered the party venue, the nobles of Alzer who knew about me were surprised.</p>
<p>They whispered to each other.</p>
<p>「Is that man the kingdom’s knight?」</p>
<p>「I heard that his nickname is Fiendish Knight. A merchant from the kingdom told me.」</p>
<p>「Oh my, how scary.」</p>
<p>I was looking for Louise-san while my heart was getting injured by the gossiping of the noble wives.</p>
<p>Marie pulled at my sleeve and talked to me in a small voice.</p>
<p>「Big bro, it’s Loic.」</p>
<p>It was Barriere House that was managing the party venue.</p>
<p>Perhaps the receptionist had reported my arrival. Loic arrived together with the head of Barriere House.</p>
<p>His name was──Bellange I think.</p>
<p>「Look who we have here, welcome to this party, sir hero of the kingdom.」</p>
<p>The man spread his arms to make a show to the surrounding. He had a large build and intimidating air.</p>
<p>Loic was smiling fearlessly beside him.</p>
<p>「I don’t remember inviting you, but please have fun here for today. After all there will be an important announcement for Alzer after this in this place.」</p>
<p>He offered me his hand so I shook it. The other side strongly grasped my hand.</p>
<p>I also grasped back.</p>
<p>「I know. Something about marriage right? Congratulations.」</p>
<p>Loic’s expression didn’t change.</p>
<p>「Sir hero have sharp ears. Well, even if it’s just a compliment but I shall take it.」</p>
<p>We both released each other’s hand.</p>
<p>Bellange talked to me.</p>
<p>「By the way I have one request to you sir hero. About the sacred tree’s sapling, it’s something very important for Alzer. No, it’s something sacred. Can you perhaps concede it to us? Of course we will prepare befitting reward to show our gratitude.」</p>
<p>I smiled at Bellange who behaved modestly with me.</p>
<p>The surrounding was also focusing at us when the topic of sapling-chan came up.</p>
<p>Thanks to that the surrounding became quiet immediately.</p>
<p>It showed really clearly how important this topic was for the commonwealth.</p>
<p>「I like it a lot so I refuse. If you want it then you can take it away from me by force. ──That’s if you can.」</p>
<p>Bellange laughed.</p>
<p>「How harsh! But we won’t give up so easily. Let’s continue the negotiation again in the future.」</p>
<p>The surrounding looked at us with hostility.</p>
<p>「A knight of the barbaric kingdom dare to…」</p>
<p>「Don’t act big after winning against just Faiviel House.」</p>
<p>「He is getting cocky because he’s still green.」</p>
<p>They were saying whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>Bellange and Loic left me because it seemed the time had come.</p>
<p>Loic gave his parting words while leaving.</p>
<p>「Then excuse us. Please have fun. Ah, also──you better give up if you’re planning to take Noelle back. She is mine.」</p>
<p>He was keeping up appearances so nobody else could see, but he was directing a dark killing intent toward me.</p>
<p>His expression made me wanted to ask him whether he was trying to make funny faces.</p>
<p>Seeing that, Marie said 「This guy」 and glared at Loic, but I responded to him with a refreshing smile.</p>
<p>「There was something similar like this before. An idiot price picked a fight with me.」</p>
<p>「Hou──and then?」</p>
<p>「Do you want to know what is that guy doing right now? Right now he is grilling meat in a food stand. The former crown prince is earning money in a meat skewer stand. It’s really a touching tale isn’t it?」</p>
<p>I wasn’t lying.</p>
<p>It was true.</p>
<p>That Julius, he would head to that stand if he had free time and worked there.</p>
<p>The person himself was really happy though, it was like 「I have found my calling!」.</p>
<p>Well, something like this was just a threat.</p>
<p>It didn’t have any effect to Loic.</p>
<p>「I’m looking forward to that. Are you going to destroy Alzer just like how you burned Faiviel House? Certainly you’re strong, but don’t think that you can survive with just that.」</p>
<p>Loic took away his gaze from us. Over there was the diplomats from other countries.</p>
<p>The diplomat of Holy Kingdom Rachelle was looking at me.</p>
<p>「Do you get it? The world isn’t that easy. You’re strong, but don’t think that everything will go as you want it with just that.」</p>
<p>「I never thought of anything like that. But, remember this. I’ll crush those who oppose me. You’re also the same. Just keep worrying forever hoping so that Noelle won’t be taken away from you.」</p>
<p>Loic glared at me before he erased his expression and put on his best face.</p>
<p>「I’ll look forward to it, sir hero of the kingdom. No, the fiendish knight was it?」</p>
<p>That unpleasant nickname was spreading until this place.</p>
<p>Marie looked disgusted at the leaving Loic.</p>
<p>「He is really an epitome of DV bastard. He is acting so that the people around him won’t notice. But more importantly big bro──can you really take Noelle back?」</p>
<p>Not only this party venue, the security around Noelle also couldn’t be compared from before.</p>
<p>It would be difficult even for Luxion to accomplish that without killing the enemy.</p>
<p>In the first place, that guy wouldn’t mind even if there was casualty from the enemies.</p>
<p>He was a guy who couldn’t solve things peacefully.</p>
<p>「I’m still thinking of how to do it. Taking Noelle back itself is easy but──」</p>
<p>「Leon-kun, long time no see.」</p>
<p>Albergue-san found me while I was thinking and came to my spot.</p>
<p>「Albergue-san.」</p>
<p>His expression looked tired somewhere in it.</p>
<p>「Why are you here today? I can’t imagine that Bellange would invite you.」</p>
<p>He didn’t know about Louise-san?</p>
<p>「No, actually──」</p>
<p>When I was going to speak about the circumstance, the venue’s lighting was erased and lamps were turned on at the stage.</p>
<p>Thre Loic appeared──with Noelle.</p>
<p>Noelle was wearing a dress, but it exposed very little skin. Her collar was also decorated.</p>
<p>And then Loic held Noelle’s hand and lifted her right hand.</p>
<p>「More than ten years has passed since Lespinasse House was destroyed. The position of priestess has been empty since then, but that’s only until today. The priestess’s crest is residing in this Noelle Zel Lespinasse’s right hand! She is a survivor of Lespinasse House that is thought to be destroyed.」</p>
<p>Applauses were raised because the people inside this venue had known about this beforehand.</p>
<p>Albergue-san’s expression was turning grim inside the dark venue.</p>
<p>Was he unable to forget his anger toward Lespinasse House just as we thought?</p>
<p>Noelle stood beside Loic and waved her hand with a smile.</p>
<p>Marie explained to me.</p>
<p>「Big bro, it’s really bad. I’m just guessing but, there are a lot of bruises under her clothes. Her expression is also stiff, and her complexion is also bad even though they’re using makeup to cover it up.」</p>
<p>「You understand that much?」</p>
<p>「It’s just my instinct.」</p>
<p>Could this girl’s instinct be relied on?</p>
<p>I was doubting her, but then a report came from Luxion who was camouflaging himself.</p>
<p>『Marie’s instinct is right on the money. The wound on her face is covered up with makeup but, there is also trace of beating on her body.』</p>
<p>Then why was she waving her hand with a smile?</p>
<p>It was Marie who answered my question.</p>
<p>「She is convincing herself that everything will be fine if she just endure. Besides, her ability to think will get whittled down gradually with how cornered she is. She will lose even her will to escape. Other people will think that a victim can just escape from this kind of situation if they really hate it. But, it’s impossible.」</p>
<p>Was that her experience talking?</p>
<p>This was infuriating.</p>
<p>Loic made a declaration.</p>
<p>「Now then, with the coming back of the priestess, surely everyone is having expectation of what lies ahead from that. As everyone know, the guardian is also nonexistent right now. But, this too will be solved soon enough. I──Loic Leta Barriere will marry Noelle and assume that position!」</p>
<p>The surrounding clapped and cheered loudly.</p>
<p>They must have made preparation beforehand.</p>
<p>My hand was grabbed within the darkness while I was watching that.</p>
<p>Louise-san was there when I turned around.</p>
<p>「I found you. Come over here.」</p>
<p>Albergue-san was also surprised.</p>
<p>「Louise, you’re the one who called him here?」</p>
<p>「I’ll explain later. But right now it’s Noelle.」</p>
<p>We slipped out from the dark party venue and entered a room that Louise-san had prepared.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p>Inside the dark venue.</p>
<p>There was one more person who noticed Leon and Marie’s appearance.</p>
<p>It was Lelia who was participating in the party with Emile.</p>
<p>(Those guys, they’re going to do as they please again!?)</p>
<p>Lelia was losing her calm seeing them leaving the venue with Albergue and Louise. She spoke to Emile.</p>
<p>「Emile, I’m going to fix my makeup.」</p>
<p>「Eh? But, just now you have──」</p>
<p>「Emile, don’t ask too much.」</p>
<p>Emile gasped when she told him that. He averted his gaze.</p>
<p>「R-right. Sorry, yeah, take your time there.」</p>
<p>It seemed he was thinking that she would go to toilet.</p>
<p>It offended her as a woman, but right now her priority was to learn about Leon and Marie’s action.</p>
<p>(Those guys, moving around as they please!)</p>
<p>Lelia followed after Leon and others.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p>We listened to Louise-san’s story. The first one who became enraged was Albergue-san.</p>
<p>「You’ve done it huh, Fernand.」</p>
<p>His anger was seeping out quietly.</p>
<p>Louise-san was looking slightly uneasy.</p>
<p>「I took advantage when the venue turned dark just now and somehow slipped away. It was almost like imprisonment for me in the mansion. There would be watcher even when I went out, while at the mansion I had almost no freedom. It looks like even my letter is checked.」</p>
<p>Why was Louise-san locked up?</p>
<p>That was because Druille House was betraying Rault House.</p>
<p>Albergue-san stood up.</p>
<p>「──Louise, you stay here. I’m going to talk with Fernand.」</p>
<p>「Otou-sama?」</p>
<p>「I’m going to take you home to our mansion today. Use my name if the people of Druille House come.」</p>
<p>Albergue-san went out of the room.</p>
<p>Then Marie let out a sigh after she was liberated from the tension.</p>
<p>「Aa~, that was scary. His pressure wasn’t a joke.」</p>
<p>Louise-san chuckled seeing Marie like that.</p>
<p>「He is usually gentle you know?」</p>
<p>「It doesn’t look like that at all.」</p>
<p>I was listening to the report from Luxion that kept coming.</p>
<p>The surrounding couldn’t hear it.</p>
<p>『Master, it seems Druille House is planning to use Louise to make Hughes into Rault House’s head.』</p>
<p>I kept hearing nothing but unpleasant story.</p>
<p>I wished there would be more cheerful story that came to me.</p>
<p>But, there were things that wouldn’t come true even if you wished for them.</p>
<p>『──There is one person eavesdropping in front of the door. It’s Lelia. Should I remove her?』</p>
<p>Why were always you that radical?</p>
<p>「I’ll let her in.」</p>
<p>Both Marie and Louise-san looked at me because I suddenly opened my mouth.</p>
<p>I stealthily approached the door and pulled it wide open. There Lelia was crouching with her ear pressed on the door just now.</p>
<p>「That’s improper you know, priestess’s little sister-san.」</p>
<p>When I laughed at her, Lelia glared at Louise-san inside the room.</p>
<p>She talked to me with a small voice.</p>
<p>「What are you planning huh? Don’t tell me, you’re going to be Rault House’s ally!?」</p>
<p>「I’m considering it positively.」</p>
<p>「Don’t dodge the question!」</p>
<p>Hearing the ruckus, Louise-san looked at Lelia and folded her arms.</p>
<p>「──Lelia, so you’re also involved. Well, it’s fine. I also wanted to talk with you. There isn’t any need to hide it anymore anyway.」</p>
<p>Louise-san permitted it, so I let Lelia entered inside and closed the door.</p>
<p>Lelia was nervous, but she was baring her hostility in front of Louise-san.</p>
<p>「──It will be over for Rault House with this.」</p>
<p>「That might be so.」</p>
<p>Louise-san didn’t look shaken at all.</p>
<p>Marie talked to me with a small voice.</p>
<p>「Hey, what is going to begin right now?」</p>
<p>「Do you think I know? That depends on these two.」</p>
<p>Lelia looked like she was already convinced of her victory. She was acting confident toward Louise-san.</p>
<p>However, she was flustered in front of Louise-san who showed no agitation.</p>
<p>「A-after this, you won’t be able to do as you please. You had been bullying big sis a lot, but you won’t be able to do that anymore.」</p>
<p>「Seems so. I won’t need to do that anymore even if we return back to the academy.」</p>
<p>She wouldn’t need to?</p>
<p>I and Marie looked at each other.</p>
<p>Marie asked Louise-san hesitantly.</p>
<p>「S-say~, didn’t you quarrel with Noelle because you hate her, or something?」</p>
<p>Louise-san laughed.</p>
<p>She laughed, and then she talked with a really nice smile.</p>
<p>「It’s true I hate that woman. I really hate her. It’s the same with Lelia over there too. They are living carefree without knowing anything, in addition they even slipped into the academy too. They even kept their name as it is. I was wondering whether they are thinking that we are so stupid.」</p>
<p>Lelia objected.</p>
<p>「T-that’s! ──It was because our retainers wrote the name like that in the application form.」</p>
<p>Well, so it wasn’t because of their own wish.</p>
<p>「When I found the two of them in the academy, I really hated them I couldn’t bear it. Even I don’t know everything. But, I know that Otou-sama let the twins who are the heiress of Lespinasse House to get away.」</p>
<p>He let the twins got away?</p>
<p>I and Marie looked at each other in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Marie shook her head side to side. She was insisting that she didn’t know what Louise-san was talking about.</p>
<p>This girl is useless.</p>
<p>Marie couldn’t ask Louise-san, so I asked in her place.</p>
<p>「I understand that you hate the two of them but, why then you only picked a quarrel with Noelle?」</p>
<p>Louise-san looked at me with a very sad gaze.</p>
<p>She clenched her hands.</p>
<p>「Otou-sama asked me to. He said it’s because the twins aren’t at fault. Lelia has Emile at her side. But, there wasn’t anyone at Noelle’s side. Pierre was also still there until just a little while ago, and the troublesome Loic was also following her around.」</p>
<p>Lelia was bewildered.</p>
<p>「What does that has to do with you picking a quarrel with big sis?」</p>
<p>It seemed Marie had noticed.</p>
<p>「Ah, could it be that was you claiming, this is my prey so hands off, is it that kind of thing?」</p>
<p>Louise-san nodded weakly.</p>
<p>「Even I don’t want to get involved with them. I hated you two who were living peacefully without knowing anything. Even though you don’t even know our feeling, just what’s with you two!?」</p>
<p>Louise-san was gradually getting high-strung. She approached Lelia and cornered her to the wall.</p>
<p>She grabbed her collar, so I and Marie separated them.</p>
<p>I said to Marie.</p>
<p>「Take her outside! I’ll take care of this one here!」</p>
<p>「O-okay. Come on, let’s get out!」</p>
<p>After the two of them got out of the room, only I and Louise-san remained inside.</p>
<p>Luxion made a teasing remark.</p>
<p>『Now master is alone with another woman. Let’s be careful so that master won’t be suspected of cheating.』</p>
<p>──Shut up, this piece of junk AI.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Okey Lelia it’s quickly becoming way worse than Marie in the first first volumes.<br/>
She “worries about the game ending” yet took safetile-kun making sure that the contingency plan it’s off the table.<br/>
She saw how uncomfortable her sister was around Loic yet never listened to her despite knowing her sister it’s an all loving “otome protagonist” so if someone its below her standards there should be a reason.<br/>
She got blinded by her own comfort and deluded herself that selling her blood related sister to a little bit off sweet talk was the right thing to do completely ignoring enough red flags to supply China.<br/>
She got told about the collar 24hrs have passed and she hasn’t confirmed it.<br/>
Finally after all has been said Noelle it’s her blood related twin sister they have been together for years she should know her best than anyone in the fucking story yet she doesn’t notice her fake smile and covered brusiers despite having gotten a heads up bysrie about the collar? She either never saw her beyond a character in game (like Leon did with Livia before waking up but at least he didn’t knew her for so long previously) or she it’s too busy thinking about the best to herself to look at her sister.<br/>
Also it seems to treat safetile-kun like trash when she doesn’t want something at least Marie took her mask seriously.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Lelia’s main sin amounts to believing that it was possible that ANY of the main Alzer nobles weren’t corrupted beyond any hope of redemption.  All of her bad decisions boil down to believing that there was any kind of goodness left in the nobility.</p>
<p>But in the end, it’s not like she had any kind of power to oppose them.  Yes, she should NEVER have trusted any of them, but her only alternative is doing nothing.  Of course doing nothing was the right answer…but she had no way of knowing that.  She should have quit trying to get the nobles to do anything good sooner, but the main damage was done with her first significant failure.  Unless she had quit before having any reason to quit, the worst damage of her various failures was already done.</p>
<p>She’s in a no-win scenario from the beginning.</p>
<p>You can blame her for not giving up when it should have been obvious, but it’s unreasonable to blame her for being placed in a no-win scenario at the outset.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>I’m not sure how that’s relevant even if it is true.  The text doesn’t support it.</p>
<p>None of the Alzer nobles were qualified to become the Guardian in the first place.  ALL the good ends in the game were unrealistic.  Marie and Leon make the exact same mistake of failing to recognize that only the bad ends are useful information.</p>
