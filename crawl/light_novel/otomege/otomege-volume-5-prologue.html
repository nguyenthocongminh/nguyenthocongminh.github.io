<h1>Prologue</h1>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p>Around the time August was going to arrive.</p>
<p>I, Leon Fou Bartfalt who was studying abroad at Alzer(アルゼル) Commonwealth was stretching myself while sitting on a chair inside the academy’s class.</p>
<p>「It’s finally over~」</p>
<p>It had become evening. The scenery outside the window looked beautiful with the orange color of the sunset.</p>
<p>The mental bias from being liberated from the supplementary lessons also affected my mind to make the scenery today looked much more beautiful.</p>
<p>Inside the classroom, other than me there were also the members from Hohlfahrt Kingdom who came here to study abroad.</p>
<p>「Haa~, we finally can have summer vacation too.」</p>
<p>Marie Fou Raffan(マリエ・フォウ・ラーファン) slumped down without looking happy at all.</p>
<p>I thought her tension would rise up because she had returned to become a student and could experience summer vacation again, and yet she was like this.</p>
<p>The one who consoled Marie who was in that state was Cara Fou Wayne(カーラ・フォウ・ウェイン).</p>
<p>Unlike the petite Marie, she had an average stature and straight long hair with navy blue color.</p>
<p>「Marie-sama, you aren’t happy even though we can finally enjoy the summer vacation?」</p>
<p>Marie turned her gaze toward the group of five who were cheerfully conversing inside the class in respond to Cara’s question.</p>
<p>Over there were the five idiots──aka our fellow overseas students from the kingdom.</p>
<p>「A holiday without any prior plan is really a fresh experience.」</p>
<p>The one who said that was Julius Rafa Hohlfahrt(ユリウス・ラファ・ホルファート).</p>
<p>The prince with blue short hair was talking about the summer vacation with a smile.</p>
<p>「There were a lot of things at the previous summer vacation. Does your highness perhaps some kind of plan?」</p>
<p>The one who asked Julius that was Jilk Fia Marmoreal(ジルク・フィア・マーモリア).</p>
<p>He was Julius’s foster brother──someone who was raised together with him since they were little to be special master and servant.</p>
<p>「What are we going to do to pass the month from now?」</p>
<p>Greg Fou Seberg(グレッグ・フォウ・セバーグ) was worrying about how to spend the summer vacation.</p>
<p>These guys were former noble youths.</p>
<p>Originally even in summer vacation their schedule would be packed due to their position.</p>
<p>But, right now their families had given up on them and they became free.</p>
<p>They seemed to be happy about that and were looking forward to the summer vacation.</p>
<p>Even Chris Fia Arclight(クリス・フィア・アークライト) who was normally not talking much and composed were getting excited talking about the summer vacation with Greg.</p>
<p>「I’m interested with the commonwealth’s weapon, so I want to have a little trip to look around for weapons. It’ll be great if there is a museum or something like that here.」</p>
<p>Visiting museum in the summer vacation, what a refined way of spending a vacation.</p>
<p>If it was me at my previous life──before I reincarnated into this world of that otome game, I would surely spend the vacation by slovenly doing nothing.</p>
<p>The last of them, Brad Fou Field(ブラッド・フォウ・フィールド) made a suggestion to the four.</p>
<p>「All of you still don’t have any plan? Then how about renting an airship and go on a cruise in the commonwealth?」</p>
<p>As expected, these guys were really rich that even word like cruise was coming out.</p>
<p>An invitation to go on a cruise was made so casually like when commoner was saying <em>Let’s go have a picnic!</em></p>
<p>Julius’s eyes brightened.</p>
<p>「That’s nice idea. We’re already studying abroad in Alzer Commonwealth, so it’s not a bad idea to go sightseeing. If we have a month, we will be able sightsee all over this country in general even if it’ll be somewhat hurried.」</p>
<p>This guy, was he planning to use the whole month just for sightseeing?</p>
<p>That was a really elegant way to use summer vacation.</p>
<p>──But it was pointless.</p>
<p>When my gaze returned to Marie, her eyes were cold in contrast to these five due to her knowledge of the reality.</p>
<p>Cara was flustered in front of Marie’s cold gaze.</p>
<p>「I-is something wrong Marie-sama?」</p>
<p>「Cara, do you think we will be able to enjoy the vacation in our position as those five’s caretaker? Until now there is no need to worry about lunch because we have school, but we’re going to have to look after those five from morning until night starting tomorrow.」</p>
<p>Marie’s expression was really chilling.</p>
<p>Only children would be happy by summer vacation, but parent with children would have their hands full.</p>
<p>Even though they had time where their children weren’t home until now, but come vacation the children would be at home from morning until night every day.</p>
<p>Any mother whether they were fulltime housewife or mother with job would have their hands full──Marie had that kind of expression.</p>
<p>It seemed that right now for Marie those five were children that had to be looked after.</p>
<p>Marie made a dry chuckle.</p>
<p>「Ufufufu──we’ll need to prepare lunch too starting tomorrow. What now, the food cost is going to pile up.」</p>
<p>This was the fate of the woman who reincarnated into the world of that otome game and aimed for reverse harem.</p>
<p>Seeing how Marie who was my little sister from the previous life ended up like this, it made me wonder how she ended up to be this sad.</p>
<p>I didn’t think that Marie could be pitied because she brought this on herself.</p>
<p>I didn’t but, seeing my little sister who aimed for a reverse harem──and ended up having to support five troublesome men, it was a fact that I felt a bit of pity for her.</p>
<p>But, it was a little funny.</p>
<p>In her current situation it was like she had five children.</p>
<p>Wasn’t this actually a fitting punishment for my stupid little sister who aimed for a reverse harem?</p>
<p>Someone pinched my cheek while I was watching Marie with a grin.</p>
<p>「T-that ‘urt」</p>
<p><em>That hurt</em>, the one I told that was a girl whose long hair was tied into side ponytail.</p>
<p>Her hair was blonde at the root with a color gradation that was turning pinker the closer it was to the tip.</p>
<p>She had a tomboyish air and an appearance that looked a bit like a gal.</p>
<p>But, the person herself was a friendly and kind girl.</p>
<p>She also had a familial side to her. There was a strong gap to this girl.</p>
<p>「Why are you smirking like that?」</p>
<p>The one who was talking to me with a smiling face, Noelle Beltre(ノエル・ベルトレ)──her real name was Noelle Zel Lespinasse(ノエル・ジル・レスピナス).</p>
<p>──That otome game had a sequel. Noelle was the main character of that second game.</p>
<p>I got away from Noelle’s hand and rubbed my cheek while answering.</p>
<p>「It’s because Marie’s situation has gotten really funny. Don’t you think it’s amusing? This is a precious data sample that showed how the result of aiming for reverse harem won’t always result in happiness.」</p>
<p>Noelle was exasperated seeing me laughing.</p>
<p>「It’s too much to call other people’s life as data sample.」</p>
<p>「My bad. But, it’s still funny.」</p>
<p>I wished that I could be allowed to at least laugh seeing how many times Marie had troubled me.</p>
<p>I was also supporting her livelihood monetarily.</p>
<p>I should be forgiven.</p>
<p>「Leon’s personality is twisted.」</p>
<p>Noelle showed an exasperated expression, but then her smile soon returned.</p>
<p>And then she brought her face closer to mine.</p>
<p>In this distance our noses almost touched.</p>

<p>「Hey, more importantly accompany me shopping when we go home.」</p>
<p>「Shopping?」</p>
<p>「I’ve been a bother in Marie-chan’s home like this, so I have to contribute too sometimes.」</p>
<p>「I think you don’t really need to mind it though.」</p>
<p>Marie-chan eh.</p>
<p>Noelle and Marie had gotten really close with each other.</p>
<p>That couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>Noelle was living in our──no, Marie’s mansion since the case with Pierre.</p>
<p>Even now I was living in Marie’s mansion.</p>
<p>The reason was──it was something really troubling that was located on the back of my right hand.</p>
<p>Right now I was claiming it was wounded and kept the hand bandaged, but under the bandage was a symbol called “the crest of guardian” that was a proof of being recognized by the sacred tree.</p>
<p>I was recognized by the sacred tree’s sapling that I secured during Pierre’s incident.</p>
<p>Originally the sacred tree would choose a priestess.</p>
<p>I heard it would be the priestess who chose the guardian, so I let my guard down.</p>
<p>I turned around to look at the seat behind me.</p>
<p>Sitting there was a boy named Jean(ジャン), a student I got acquainted with at the commonwealth.</p>
<p>We were receiving supplementary lessons here because we didn’t attend the academy during the incident that Pierre caused.</p>
<p>We were receiving supplementary lessons until now to make up for that.</p>
<p>「Are you going to go home after this too Jean? Then how about you go shopping together with us too?」</p>
<p>I observed Noelle while inviting Jean.</p>
<p>She looked like she was somewhat sulking──was it just my imagination?</p>
<p>「I have something I have to do after this. I plan to visit the house of relatives who had been taking care of me. It seemed I had made them worry. They sent me a letter asking me to come visiting.」</p>
<p>Jean refused my invitation with a smile.</p>
<p>「Besides, I’ll feel bad if I got in the way of you two.」</p>
<p>Jean said that and turned his gaze at Noelle.</p>
<p>Noelle looked slightly embarrassed.</p>
<p>──Until just a little while ago, I thought the one who Noelle liked was Jean.</p>
<p>This male student called Jean wasn’t a capture target, he was just a mob.</p>
<p>If Noelle liked Jean, then I thought it couldn’t be helped but──it seemed it was just my misunderstanding.</p>
<p>This was troubling.</p>
<p>If Noelle was the main character of this second game, she needed to marry one of the capture targets.</p>
<p>The world would be in danger if she didn’t do that.</p>
<p>The world might be destroyed because of some youngsters’ romance.</p>
<p>What an unpleasant world.</p>
<p>And yet, the current situation wasn’t really good.</p>
<p>The capture targets of the second game──Noelle’s lover candidates actually had weak common ground with her at the present.</p>
<p>The first candidate, Loic Leta Barriere(ロイク・レタ・バリエル) was the main capture target but──this guy had become Noelle’s stalker.</p>
<p>I heard that even in the game his monopolizing desire was a bit strong, but he was an even more dangerous guy than I imagined.</p>
<p>Because of that Noelle hated him and he was removed from being a lover candidate.</p>
<p>The second candidate was Narcisse Calse Granze(ナルシス・カルセ・グランジュ).</p>
<p>This person was a teacher of the academy. He was a noble who had passion for archeology and often went out for fieldwork due to his hobby.</p>
<p>He was a bit too enthusiastic with his hobby, but he wasn’t a bad person.</p>
<p>Even so, at present he had no point of contact with Noelle at all.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a matter whether Noelle conscious or not toward him, it was at the level of 「Narcisse-sensei? Aa, now that you mention it there is also a teacher with that name」.</p>
<p>In the game, if you didn’t take Narcisse’s special class as a major subject until you advanced to the second year, there wouldn’t be any flag with him and he would get automatically removed from the candidate list.</p>
<p>Speaking of automatic removal, there was also one more person who had vanished.</p>
<p>It was Hughes Toara Druille(ユーグ・トアラ・ドルイユ).</p>
<p>If Noelle didn’t raise this guy’s flag at the first year, he would get automatically removed when she advanced to the second year──from there the two of them wouldn’t have anymore relation with each other.</p>
<p>Noelle didn’t make any contact with this third candidate too and it became impossible for him to become a lover candidate.</p>
<p>Next the fourth person was Emile Laz Pleven(エミール・ラズ・プレヴァン), but this guy was a lover candidate who was so easy to capture that he was called “safe tile”.</p>
<p>However, a reincarnator──Lelia Beltre(レリア・ベルトレ) who reincarnated to be Noelle’s twin little sister became his lover.</p>
<p>That stupid Lelia stole Emile.</p>
<p>It was a situation where four of the lover candidates were completely impossible to get together with Noelle like this. As for the last one, Serge Sara Rault(セルジュ・サラ・ラウルト), he didn’t attend the academy in the first place.</p>
<p>On top of having no encounter at all, this guy’s family was in a complicated relationship with Noelle.</p>
<p>After all, this guy’s adopted father, Albergue Sara Rault(アルベルク・サラ・ラウルト)──was the last boss.</p>
<p>His older stepsister Louise Sara Rault(ルイーゼ・サラ・ラウルト)──was the second game’s villainess.</p>
<p>And then, Rault House was the house that destroyed Lespinasse House.</p>
<p>I would be forced to answer it was difficult if I was asked whether the two of them could get together after this.</p>
<p>──The boys who were the capture target had been exterminated from the list.</p>
<p>In addition, even though I wasn’t even Noelle’s lover, the sacred tree’s sapling got the nerve to choose me as the guardian.</p>
<p>No matter how I looked at it this was checkmate.</p>
<p>While I was thinking, Noelle pinched my shirt and made me stood up.</p>
<p>「Come on, quick.」</p>
<p>「I got it so don’t pull my clothes.」</p>
<p>The two of us left the classroom.</p>
<p>Noelle called at Marie just before we left.</p>
<p>「Marie-chan, we’re going to buy the seasoning that’s going to run out.」</p>
<p>Marie made a slightly complicated expression when she heard that.</p>
<p>「T-thank you. More importantly, big──Leon. I got something to talk to you when you returned.」</p>
<p>She almost called me 「Big bro」 before she hurriedly corrected herself. But still, something to talk with me?</p>
<p>She couldn’t talk about it in this place meant that it must be about our plan from here.</p>
<p>「Yeah, got it. I’ll get back quickly.」</p>
<p>Then Marie sent her gaze briefly toward Noelle before her gaze returned back at me again.</p>
<p>「──The dinner preparation will be troublesome, you two go eat by yourself. We can have the talk at night.」</p>
<p>「I-is that so?」</p>
<p>Something was strange with Marie’s behavior.</p>
<p>Recently she often acted like this.</p>
<p>But then I headed to go shopping with Noelle without saying anything more.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p>At night.</p>
<p>I and Noelle was having dinner in an open terrace area of a restaurant after finishing our shopping.</p>
<p>There were three large plates on a round table with a candle placed on it.</p>
<p>Near our hands there were small plates with a small bread placed on them.</p>
<p>We placed the brown paper bag filled with the things we purchased on the empty chair.</p>
<p>I was struggling hard against the boiled lobster dish while eating.</p>
<p>「This is hard to eat.」</p>
<p>Just a little while ago I received a lot of reparation money from the commonwealth in regard to Pierre’s case, so I decided to splurge a bit and bought an expensive cooking. But this was the result.</p>
<p>It was a pain eating something that I wasn’t used to.</p>
<p>「I can’t bear watching this. Let me try.」</p>
<p>Noelle who was watching took away the crustacean ingredient that looked like a lobster from me.</p>
<p>Then she dismantled it easily unlike me.</p>
<p>After Noelle took out the meat, she placed it on a small plate and gave it to me.</p>
<p>Noelle used a napkin that was placed on the table and wiped her hands while looking a bit proudly at me saying 「How’s that」.</p>
<p>「That’s amazing. So it can be dismantled this cleanly.」</p>
<p>「Dismantle──well, it’s not wrong to call it that. So? Now it’s easier to eat like this right?」</p>
<p>When I tried eating it, the meat was tender and delicious.</p>
<p>I could hear the voices of other customers enjoying themselves from inside the restaurant.</p>
<p>I also could hear the voices of the waiters reading the customers’ order.</p>
<p>There was also the light from inside the restaurant and the street light. Although the top of the table was a bit dark, but we still could see quite clearly.</p>
<p>It created quite a nice atmosphere instead which was good in its own way.</p>
<p>「This is tasty. Try it too Noelle.」</p>
<p>「It makes me feel awkward to have you treating me every time. Leon, aren’t you wasting too much money recently?」</p>
<p>The incident with Pierre had been settled and now I was enjoying life in the commonwealth quite much.</p>
<p>There were a lot of problems still remaining, but that was that, this was this.</p>
<p>「Most of what I bought were souvenirs. My family back home are annoying for this kind of thing.」</p>
<p>The one who was annoying me with their demand for souvenir was my family──my big sister Jena(ジェナ) and my little sister Finley(フィンリー).</p>
<p>They pestered me for fine gifts for souvenirs.</p>
<p>I also needed to give present for the people that I was indebted to, so I splurged quite a lot.</p>
<p>But, there was reason for all those spending so there was no problem.</p>
<p>Noelle’s gaze turned doubtful at my claim that my spending couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>「But, those new tea sets are unnecessary aren’t they? Just how much those tea sets inside the dedicated bag cost?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha──Noelle, do you want to try this one too? It’s delicious.」</p>
<p>There were really nice tea sets in the commonwealth.</p>
<p>With so much money in my pocket right now, I couldn’t help but want to get them.</p>
<p>But, the only things that I bought for myself were just those tea sets.</p>
<p>The things other than that were mostly just daily necessities.</p>
<p>「Leon?」</p>
<p>Noelle wouldn’t let me change the topic, so I confessed honestly.</p>
<p>「──All of them amounted to a hundred thousand in total.」</p>
<p>A hundred thousand──of course it wasn’t in yen.</p>
<p>If it was converted to Japanese yen, then the cost would be around ten million in total.</p>
<p>Noelle looked shocked. It seemed the price far surpassed her imagination.</p>
<p>「Before this you also bought things like expensive tea leaves or sweets didn’t you?」</p>
<p>「I wanted to do a tea party with the new tea sets! This is my hobby! Noelle yourself, you also drank the tea and ate the sweets!」</p>
<p>To begin with, the one who I invited to the tea party was Noelle.</p>
<p>「N-no, that was, you know──they were delicious, so」</p>
<p>There were few entertainments in this other world.</p>
<p>For a modern person like me, it should be fine to have at least one hobby like this.</p>
<p>「It’s one of my few hobbies.」</p>
<p>When I acted down, Noelle seemed to feel guilty and apologized.</p>
<p>「S-sorry. I said too much. Even so, I never expected that Leon’s hobby is something like tea.」</p>
<p>Well, even myself acted 「Tea? Aa~, yeah yeah, tea huh」 until some time ago.</p>
<p>However, my sense of value changed after my encounter with master.</p>
<p>「Noelle too will surely get it if you participate in master’s tea party.」</p>
<p>Noelle resumed her meal when she saw me praising master happily.</p>
<p>「I have heard that many times.」</p>
<p>I guess. I had talked a lot about that after all.</p>
<p>I also resumed my meal. Then a waiter approached us.</p>
<p>「Does dear customer wish to order more?」</p>
<p>Noelle didn’t order anymore, but I did.</p>
<p>「Please bring the most expensive juice here.」</p>
<p>I tried ordering something expensive to act like a rich person.</p>
<p>The waiter made a troubled smile.</p>
<p>「I-I’m sorry, there isn’t any juice with price that expensive.」</p>
<p>I knew that because I had seen the menu before.</p>
<p>「I’m joking. Give us two more drinks. The same things like before are fine.」</p>
<p>I ordered the same drinks like our first order.</p>
<p>Noelle also looked fine with that.</p>
<p>When the waiter left, Noelle asked me.</p>
<p>「You aren’t drinking alcohol huh Leon? Even though Marie-chan and the others are drinking. Isn’t it rare even at the kingdom for someone to not drink?」</p>
<p>In this world you would be allowed to drink alcohol when you were 17 years old.</p>
<p>You would be treated as adult at 15 years old, so whether one drank alcohol or not would be their own responsibility after that.</p>
<p>But I wasn’t that interested in alcohol.</p>
<p>「I’ve decided to drink alcohol when I’m twenty.」</p>
<p>「Why’s that?」</p>
<p>「It’s my personal rule.」</p>
<p>It wasn’t like I was that fixated with that rule but──it made me felt somewhat awkward to drink in this age, so I decided to not drink until I was twenty. In the first place I also didn’t want to drink alcohol that badly.</p>
<p>Noelle smiled.</p>
<p>And then her smile turned a bit sad.</p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>When I asked her, Noelle shook her head.</p>
<p>Her side ponytail fluttered.</p>
<p>「It was my dream to have meal like this.」</p>
<p>Those words made me recalled the face of Noelle’s little sister.</p>
<p>「What about Lelia?」</p>
<p>Noelle’s expression turned a bit dissatisfied.</p>
<p>This girl’s expression often changed rapidly.</p>
<p>「Leon really can’t read the atmosphere, you’re dense. Well, it’s not like I mind that side of yours. ──There is saying that sisters would one day separate from each other, in the first place Lelia doesn’t wish to do this kind of thing.」</p>
<p>「He~eh」</p>
<p>Did something happen between these sisters?</p>
<p>Well, if it was that Lelia, it wouldn’t be strange if something did happen.</p>
<p>After all the current situation was partly because of that girl’s fault.</p>
<p>「Well, it’s good if you have fun.」</p>
<p>Noelle looked at my face when I said that.</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>Noelle showed me a smile. Her face looked really pretty.</p>
<p>「I’m just thinking that you look like you’re enjoying the food. More importantly, about after this──」</p>
<p>Noelle wanted to ask about the plan after this, but there was footsteps approaching our table.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the waiter, but someone who was our acquaintance.</p>
<p>I looked at that person’s face. She was clearly making a displeased face.</p>
<p>──Lelia was raising an eyebrow with her hand on her waist. She didn’t even try to hide her displeasure.</p>
<p>「There isn’t any need to look that displeased.」</p>
<p>Noelle frowned and averted her face from Lelia.</p>
<p>「Lelia, do you need something?」</p>
<p>An awkward tension drifted between the two. The customers around were also looking this way with interest.</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>「You show up just when we were talking about you. Well, sit down. Do you want to drink something?」</p>
<p>Lelia averted her face from me when I addressed her.</p>
<p>「No need to bother! ──I also come here with company.」</p>
<p>When I looked behind Lelia, there was Emile with his silky blue hair standing slightly behind her.</p>
<p>He was wearing an expensive looking suit.</p>
<p>I grinned when I saw him.</p>
<p>「What, are you in a date?」</p>
<p>「Shut up! Forget about that, today I’m going to come to your house.」</p>
<p>Noelle’s expression turned grave when she heard that.</p>
<p>「Lelia, I told you already to not be a nuisance.」</p>
<p>「It’s something important so just be quiet big sis.」</p>
<p>Lelia only said what she wanted to say before she left our table.</p>
<p>Emile made an apologetic face and bowed slightly to us before chasing after Lelia.</p>
<p>The surrounding got a bit noisy. It was then the waiter who had been observing the scene just now came bringing the juice we ordered.</p>
<p>「Thank you for waiting.」</p>
<p>I put some money on the waiter’s tray to make up for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>The waiter happily left seeing that.</p>
<p>Noelle was looking down.</p>
<p>Lelia──that girl was the same reincarnator like us.</p>
<p>Also she was knowledgeable about that otome game’s sequel.</p>
<p>「──Today let’s go back after we finished eating.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>Noelle was looking dejected, so we went home right away today.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p>After I returned to the mansion, I talked with Marie in the dining room about the plan from here.</p>
<p>The clock that was placed inside the room was showing the time had gone past 11 PM.</p>
<p>「──That Lelia, she is late.」</p>
<p>My irritation kept growing because she hadn’t showed up yet. My finger was tapping on the table. Then Marie yawned.</p>
<p>「She was in a date right? Perhaps she is playing around. Or perhaps the mood turned good and she won’t be able to come today.」</p>
<p>The sleepy looking Marie rubbed her eyes and said that it couldn’t be helped even if Lelia didn’t come.</p>
<p>「Making other people waiting like this, is that girl screwing around?」</p>
<p>「I’m telling you, the two of them will go until the end if they got heated up in their date right? Ah, I see. A wuss like big bro won’t understand something like that.」</p>
<p>I was irritated that she was calling me a wuss.</p>
<p>「What do you mean by that?」</p>
<p>「No matter how I look at it, aren’t big bro’s attitude toward Noelle like a wuss. In the first place, it was also horrible when the fiancées who big bro left back home confessed to you wasn’t it?」</p>
<p>Angelica and Livia ran out of patience against me who wouldn’t give an answer no matter how long they waited, and so it was the two of them who confessed to me.</p>
<p>C-certainly, I might be a wuss at that time.</p>
<p>But, it was different with Noelle.</p>
<p>「Why are you calling my attitude toward Noelle a wuss huh?」</p>
<p>When I argued back, Marie made a face that looked really displeased.</p>
<p>「Big bro is really the worst.」</p>
<p>「──You are calling me the worst without even explaining the reason? Tell me, who is the one who get her livelihood supported by such man?」</p>
<p>When I attacked Marie’s weak point, she protested tearfully.</p>
<p>「That attitude is also the worst!」</p>
<p>Luxion came to the dining room while we were noisily arguing with each other.</p>
<p>He had the appearance of metallic spherical body and a single red eye.</p>
<p>Today too he was notifying me with a way of speaking that was really unsuitable for when talking with his master.</p>
<p>『I also can’t deny that master is a wuss.』</p>
<p>「Oi!?」</p>
<p>『More importantly, a guest has arrived.』</p>
<p>When I looked outside the window from the dining room, the outside was bright.</p>
<p>It was the light that came from a car.</p>
<p>「Is that Lelia?」</p>
<p>『It looks like Emile is escorting her here.』</p>
<p>Emile was really kind.</p>
<p>Marie headed to the entrance, then after a while she returned with Lelia in tow.</p>
<p>Emile’s car was leaving from the mansion.</p>
<p>After Lelia sat down, Marie poured her a drink from the pot that had been prepared.</p>
<p>Lelia accepted it and suddenly entered the main topic.</p>
<p>「And, what are we going to do from now?」</p>
<p>Marie and I looked at each other, and then we both scoffed and shrugged.</p>
<p>Lelia scowled seeing our gesture and hit the table.</p>
<p>「What’s with that attitude!」</p>
<p>Marie responded haughtily.</p>
<p>「You came this late and then suddenly asked what are we going to do? In the first place, it’s your responsibility that the situation become troubling like this though?」</p>
<p>Lelia who got accused that this was her fault stood up and objected.</p>
<p>「Things had been going well until now with my way! If you two didn’t mess up everything, even big sis and Loic──w-well, it might be difficult.」</p>
<p>Even Lelia was shaken.</p>
<p>The current Loic to put it mildly was a stalker.</p>
<p>To be honest, he was a criminal already.</p>
<p>Ah, there was no difference between the two I guess.</p>
<p>And then Noelle was harboring disgust toward him in the level of 「It’s physiologically impossible」.</p>
<p>The difficulty would be too difficult to make them became lovers from here so it was wiser to give up here.</p>
<p>I prepared teacake for Lelia.</p>
<p>「I investigated the situation of the guys who can become Noelle’s lover candidate but, the possibility is annihilated already.」</p>
<p>When I looked at Luxion, he continued after me and told Lelia the situation.</p>
<p>『About Narcisse, he has no student at all in this school year and it’s very likely he will leave the academy. And then regarding Hughes, talk of his engagement is in progress right now. Emile is already in romantic relationship with you so he is out of the question. In that case the remaining candidate is only Serge. Currently his whereabouts is unknown so the information is lacking.』</p>
<p>It wasn’t because Luxion was unable to investigate, it was more a problem of resource.</p>
<p>He would be able to find Serge if he seriously investigated his whereabouts. But the problem was after we found him.</p>
<p>Noelle was avoiding the topic of Serge. Rather than because of Serge personally, she was avoiding the topic of Rault House altogether. The possibility of him becoming Noelle’s lover was low.</p>
<p>Lelia made a troubled voice.</p>
<p>「Serge huh──」</p>
<p>「Do you know something?」</p>
<p>Lelia seemed evasive for some reason when I asked her for explanation about Serge.</p>
<p>「──Serge is yearning to be an adventurer, so he often skipped school.」</p>
<p>「I had heard about that.」</p>
<p>Previously when I was invited to Rault House, I heard the story about how Serge had yearning for the adventurer profession.</p>
<p>「Well, that’s──even I thought that a spare was needed in case it failed with Loic, so I also approached Serge.」</p>
<p>Marie tilted her head.</p>
<p>「Then why were you fixated with Loic? Don’t tell me, you also failed with Serge!?」</p>
<p>「Don’t call it failure! T-that’s not it I’m telling you. No, that’s it though.」</p>
<p>This girl was really unclear.</p>
<p>Was it a failure or not, which one?</p>
<p>「Just what’s the deal with that Serge-kun?」</p>
<p>Lelia gave up and talked about Serge.</p>
<p>「──It went smoothly until I became acquainted with Serge. But, big sis won’t accept it because he is from Rault House, and Serge himself──he isn’t interested with big sis.」</p>
<p>Both Noelle and Serge weren’t interested with each other.</p>
<p>I didn’t think that there was any problem if that was all.</p>
<p>However, Lelia continued.</p>
<p>「That guy, he said to me “I like you”.」</p>
<p>Lelia said that with a red face. Seeing that Marie made an extremely irritated face and clicked her tongue.</p>
<p>What’s this──I felt scared and couldn’t interrupt the talk.</p>
<p>「You, even though you were telling me “I can’t believe you would aim for something like reverse harem!” so annoyingly like that, you yourself were making a pass at two men? I can’t trust a woman like you the most.」</p>
<p>Lelia also talked back.</p>
<p>「I’m still better than you who are keeping five boyfriends!」</p>
<p>Well, certainly when comparing five people with two people, Lelia was still better even if it was just a scant difference──wasn’t it?</p>
<p>But, it was really a stalemate if it was like this.</p>
<p>「This is checkmate huh.」</p>
<p>My words made Lelia pointed her finger at me and protested.</p>
<p>She was getting teary.</p>
<p>「Don’t say that! My plan went out of the rail because you become the guardian!」</p>
<p>I wished she would stop with the false accusation.</p>
<p>It was this woman who caused the checkmate situation even before I became the guardian.</p>
<p>「It’s not my fault. Even if it’s actually really my fault, it’s your fault for creating this kind of situation.」</p>
<p>Lelia got angry when I spoke bluntly like that.</p>
<p>She was lashing out even though she was the one in the wrong.</p>
<p>「You are saying it’s my fault!?」</p>
<p>「Obviously. In the society, it’s the guy’s own fault if they got cornered into checkmate. In the first place, the situation wouldn’t become like this if only you put more importance on Noelle’s own opinion. Also if you created a chance for her to meet with Hughes or Narcisse, then we would still have options right now.」</p>
<p>Lelia couldn’t say anything back and looked frustrated.</p>
<p>Well, it was also natural for her to want to complaint at us after we messed up her plan.</p>
<p>Even so, she was at fault for creating this situation.</p>
<p>「Besides, what about you yourself? You secured the safest character Emile for yourself. Even though if you think about the situation then you should have avoided him.」</p>
<p>Behind me Marie was cheering 「Tell her! Tell her more big bro! Beat up the opponent with your preaching until they can’t stand anymore like usual!」.</p>
<p>Just what kind of person do you think I am?</p>
<p>「You should leave safe tile-kun so it should at least be possible to recover back no matter what is the situation. Do you have the awareness that it was you who created this situation?」</p>
<p>「Normally will someone really speak that far toward other person!?」</p>
<p>「If it’s me then I’m going to say it. Don’t think that all men will be unconditionally kind toward woman. Just so you know, I have nothing to fear anymore!」</p>
<p>Yes──I had nothing to fear anymore.</p>
<p>Because, I had two beautiful and kind fiancées.</p>
<p>I didn’t fear anything anymore now.</p>
<p>Lelia looked down.</p>
<p>She apologized with a small voice.</p>
<p>「I, I think I’m at fault. Even I never imagined that Loic will become that horrible. At the first year I thought that it would be alright and felt relieved.」</p>
<p>So she let her guard down and failed.</p>
<p>Thanks to that the danger to the world was getting closer.</p>
<p>But nothing would be resolved even if we continued talking about this.</p>
<p>「Now then, let’s discuss strategy about from here on again.」</p>
<p>I looked toward Luxion. He was going to explain several strategies for from here on.</p>
<p>『Well then, about the plan from here on──master, something important come up.』</p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>Luxion stopped his explanation and notified me of an outrageous information.</p>
<p>『An airship that is carrying Angelica and Olivia is approaching rapidly from the kingdom to here. Creare is also on board. It seems to be an emergency.』</p>
<p>「Emergency!?」</p>
<p>Did something happen at the kingdom?</p>
<p>For those two to come to the commonwealth in so much of a hurry, did a major incident happen?</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>Luxion’s main body, the spaceship was currently near me──it was floating near the commonwealth. Because of that I couldn’t receive news from the kingdom in real time.</p>
<p>「When are they going to arrive?」</p>
<p>『They will arrive at the harbor tomorrow morning.』</p>
<p>「D-did something happen!?」</p>
<p>『I don’t know yet. There wasn’t any report at all from Creare.』</p>
<p>Just what happened at the kingdom at this kind of time?</p>
