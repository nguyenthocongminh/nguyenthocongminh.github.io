<h1>Chapter 6 – The Destined Person</h1>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p>Marie’s mansion was quiet.</p>
<p>Part of it was because the usually noisy five idiots were gone, but it was also because of the dark and gloomy atmosphere.</p>
<p>It was already night. Marie planned to sleep when this was over.</p>
<p>Cara talked to Marie who was in such state.</p>
<p>「Marie-sama, about Noelle-san」</p>
<p>「Was there something?」</p>
<p>「She had lived together with us before this too, so there’s nothing troubling. But, how should I say it, it’s like she is putting on a brave face. Sometimes she will look very depressed.」</p>
<p>The day Marie saved Noelle.</p>
<p>Actually Creare was monitoring Noelle’s situation. Because of that they managed to notice Loic’s approach.</p>
<p>Marie made it in time to protect Noelle, but her condition was strange.</p>
<p>「──I see. I’ll take care of it, so Cara, you go rest already.」</p>
<p>「Y-yes.」</p>
<p>Marie ordered Cara to rest and stopped writing on her household account book. She held her head while lying on the table.</p>
<p>「Stupid big bro. What am I going to do now」</p>
<p>──The priestess’s crest had appeared on the back of Noelle’s right hand.</p>
<p>Leon had returned to the kingdom before knowing that.</p>
<p>Luxion’s main body was also returning temporarily to the kingdom, so this news still hadn’t reached Leon.</p>
<p>She intended to report this later because Leon would return soon.</p>
<p>Creare was with her right now so she was reassured, but the problem wasn’t the crest but Noelle herself.</p>
<p>(Why does she have to fall in love with big bro!? What’s good from him? His personality is bad, his mouth is bad, his appearance is average, well yeah he’s good in earning money. In the matter of resourcefulness than big bro is exceptional──oh no. Perhaps big bro is actually someone amazing.)</p>
<p>Compared to Julius and others, the like of Leon wouldn’t even enter into a consideration──it was something that she couldn’t say.</p>
<p>Leon had obtained Luxion and his status right now was a count.</p>
<p>In addition he had just obtained reparation money from the commonwealth, so he was also rich.</p>
<p>If she closed her eyes toward his bad personality and mouth, then he was a really excellent find.</p>
<p>「Hah! That’s not it. The problem is big bro! I’ve noticed from some time ago that Noelle harbor a feeling to big bro, but he himself doesn’t notice that.」</p>
<p>Marie had noticed since Leon and Noelle came to this mansion.</p>
<p>Noelle was conscious toward Leon.</p>
<p>But Leon didn’t realize that.</p>
<p>Just before the summer vacation arrived, Noelle was blatantly making appeal at Leon, and yet──he didn’t even notice it.</p>
<p>(Really, just why do you hate dense character so much? You’re a dense character yourself. What’s more you’re the super dense type!)</p>
<p>Leon hated dense character in the story where they wouldn’t notice the feeling of the opposite sex, but he didn’t notice at all that he had been standing in the same position.</p>
<p>Marie was worrying whether she should say anything.</p>
<p>Leon had two fiancées──she should say that from the start, but she couldn’t say it when she saw how happy Noelle was.</p>
<p>Noelle was a really good girl.</p>
<p>She would help with housework while staying in this mansion. Her bright and candid personality wasn’t unpleasant even between fellow girls.</p>
<p>To be honest, she even wanted to cheer for Noelle.</p>
<p>Thanks to that she was unable to say the truth to Noelle.</p>
<p>She felt guilty because of that.</p>
<p>(I should have told her faster.)</p>
<p>She was irritated to Leon who didn’t notice Noelle’s feeling at all.</p>
<p>(Big bro was also like that. Does he know how much Noelle was appealing to him? It made me angry just from watching it.)</p>
<p>It was infuriating, but the problem wouldn’t be resolved just by feeling angry.</p>
<p>Marie gave up and decided to talk with Noelle.</p>
<p>She went to Noelle’s room.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p>Marie arrived while Noelle was just being absentminded in her room.</p>
<p>Noelle forcefully made a smile at Marie’s arrival. After Marie entered they sat face to face.</p>
<p>Noelle was sitting on the bed, while Marie was sitting on a chair.</p>
<p>「What do you want to talk about at this late?」</p>
<p>Noelle didn’t understand why Marie visited her room.</p>
<p>That was why she asked, but Marie apologized to her.</p>
<p>「I’m sorry. If only I told you faster」</p>
<p>She guessed what Marie wanted to say just from that.</p>
<p>Noelle also wished that Marie would tell her sooner, but she looked down and shook her head.</p>
<p>「It’s fine. I was just getting excited by myself. It’s not strange for someone like Leon-kun to have fiancée. A-as I thought, the good men are sold out quickly.」</p>
<p><em>Ahahaha, </em>Noelle laughed cheerfully but──it made her wanted to cry.</p>
<p>Marie was looking sadly at Noelle.</p>
<p>「Just what is good from Leon?」</p>
<p>「You are asking me that now? Well, it’s fine though. It felt reassuring when I was with him. It’s something precious for me to be able to stay at someone’s side without needing to worry about anything. I was even thinking that it wouldn’t be bad to follow Leon back to his country like this.」</p>
<p>The matter of Lespinasse House.</p>
<p>The matter of priestess.</p>
<p>And then the matter of Alzer Commonwealth.</p>
<p>She came to think that she wanted to go with him even if she had to throw away various things.</p>
<p>(So in the end, it’s impossible to get away from the sacred tree.)</p>
<p>Wasn’t it felt like the sacred tree wouldn’t let anyone get away once they got involved with it? That was how it felt to her.</p>
<p>Noelle glanced briefly at the bandage around her right hand.</p>
<p>And then she told Marie a certain story.</p>
<p>「Marie-chan, do you know? There’s a famous story in Alzer.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「There are a guardian and a priestess in Alzer, though there aren’t any right now. The priestess was turning out from among the female of a certain family for generations.」</p>
<p>Lespinasse House was a house with woman as the head of the house.</p>
<p>That was because only woman could inherit the priestess’s crest.</p>
<p>「But, only the guardian’s crest cannot be inherited. The priestess will choose the man in that generation who she believe to be the one most worthy.」</p>
<p>The crests of the priestess and the six great nobles were passed down based on bloodline, but only the guardian was chosen based on the person’s real strength.</p>
<p>And then it was the priestess who chose the guardian.</p>
<p>Marie was calm.</p>
<p>「I don’t know the detail, but I think I’ve heard about it.」</p>
<p>「Ah, so you know. Then I’ll just say the conclusion──the priestess can choose someone she loves as the guardian. And then the guardian’s crest will appear for the first time when the guardian also loves the priestess. That sounds really romantic right?」</p>
<p>Marie agreed that it was romantic, but there was something that bothered her.</p>
<p>「But, the guardian is fundamentally chosen from among the six great nobles isn’t it?」</p>
<p>「Yes. Well, that’s because it’s someone strong who will be chosen as the guardian, while almost all of the powerful people in the commonwealth are those who have crest. The exception of that──is just one person I think?」</p>
<p>That was her own father.</p>
<p>Her father didn’t come from the six great nobles, in addition he didn’t have a crest.</p>
<p>Her mother chose her father who was such a person.</p>
<p>「──That’s why, there is a legend that if you become the priestess, then any kind of impossible love will come true.」</p>
<p>But, Noelle’s love didn’t come true.</p>
<p>(As I thought, it’s just a legend.)</p>
<p>Noelle said.</p>
<p>「If, if──the priestess’s crest appeared on me, do you think that the guardian’s crest will appear on Leon?」</p>
<p>Marie made a serious expression toward her question.</p>
<p>And then she closed her eyes and nodded.</p>
<p>「He would surely get chosen.」</p>
<p>「Is that so? Then──that’s great.」</p>
<p>Her heart was weakening.</p>
<p>She wanted to tell someone about the priestess’s crest right away and asked that person to help her.</p>
<p>That person in Noelle’s imagination was Leon, but she then shook her head.</p>
<p>「Aa~, as I thought heartbreak is really painful. Sorry, please give me a bit more time. I’ll be able to forget about Leon after a while.」</p>
<p>To be honest, Noelle right now was thinking that she was glad Leon was gone from her side.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p>After Marie left Noelle’s room, she held her head in her hands.</p>
<p>(SHE IS SERIOUSLY ILLLLL! Rather, does she also forget that I was there when the priestess’s crest appeared on her hand!? Certainly it would be strange if I know about the priestess’s crest though! But you should be more on your guard!)</p>
<p>They had lived together until now, but Noelle never gave any hint that she was a survivor of Lespinasse House.</p>
<p>And yet it was completely obvious that she had obtained a crest.</p>
<p>She often looked at the back of her right hand and sighed.</p>
<p>(BIG BRO YOU IDIOTTTTT!! Just how did you mess up so seriously like this!)</p>
<p>Marie cursed Leon who wasn’t here.</p>
<p>The person that Noelle chose was Leon of all people.</p>
<p>If Leon didn’t have any fiancée, than even Marie would fully support them.</p>
<p>However she couldn’t do that because there were Ange and Livia.</p>
<p>(What now. With Noelle state right now, it really doesn’t look like she will be able to find her next love.)</p>
<p>If they were unlucky, Noelle’s state might drag on for several years.</p>
<p>That would be no good.</p>
<p>They would graduate the academy first at that rate.</p>
<p>If they were unlucky, Noelle might even say something like <em>Perhaps it would be better to stay single like this?</em> in her current state.</p>
<p>(Man. Anyway I need to introduce Noelle to a man──aa, no good. I can’t think of anyone who will work. Shit! What should I do now!)</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p>The location was the mansion of Druille House.</p>
<p>Loic was invited there.</p>
<p>He was talking with Fernand who was making a stiff expression.</p>
<p>「──Dragging down Rault House from the seat of acting chairman? Thast’s really extreme of you Loic-kun.」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>Loic was calmly thinking of the method to obtain Noelle.</p>
<p>There was someone who would be a hindrance at that time.</p>
<p>It wasn’t Albergue. It was Louise.</p>
<p>Louise often picked a quarrel with Noelle, but because of that he was unable to do anything a lot of times.</p>
<p>In addition, it would also be difficult to convince his father if Rault House stayed as the acting chairman.</p>
<p>Fernand sent him a sharp gaze.</p>
<p>「Druille House has a debt with Rault House. Albergue-dono acted as my backer when I succeeded as the head of the house despite my youth.」</p>
<p>「I know. If I remember right, the two houses has been strongly connected since two generations ago isn’t it?」</p>
<p>「It’s good that you understand.」</p>
<p>The blood connection between the six great nobles was also thick.</p>
<p>It was said that only a member of six great nobles was worthy for another member of the six great nobles.</p>
<p>But, because of that their blood became too close to each other.</p>
<p>Louise wasn’t married to Fernand was also mostly because of that.</p>
<p>His little brother Hughes was born from a different mother. The blood of his mother was distant from Rault House so it was Hughes and Louise who were betrothed to each other.</p>
<p>Fernand had been designated to be the head of the house since the beginning. Hughes also had no complaint about that, so the relationship between the brothers was good.</p>
<p>But, even this connection was changing following the passing of time.</p>
<p>In fact, there was also a period when Druille House was in conflict with Rault House a long time ago. There was also a period when the connection between Barriere House and Rault House was strong.</p>
<p>Their relationship varied depending on the era.</p>
<p>Loic also knew that Fernand was in Albergue’s debt.</p>
<p>But he also knew Fernand’s character very well.</p>
<p>(This person look mild, but he is actually the one with the strongest patriotism for Alzer.)</p>
<p>「I brought this talk to you even knowing about your debt to Albergue-dono. Fernand-san should also understand. That Albergue-dono isn’t fitting to be the acting chairman. The proof is his weak attitude toward the kingdom.」</p>
<p>Fernand’s expression turned grim.</p>
<p>「He isn’t just showing a weak attitude. Einhorn──that airship is already mass produced and there was even one ship of the same type anchored at the harbor before this. What are we going to do if we continue showing a belligerent attitude toward such country?」</p>
<p>「It’ll be troubling if he become cowardly because of that. It’ll cause a problem for the negotiation in the future.」</p>
<p>Fernand had a strong feeling of patriotism.</p>
<p>Furthermore it was based on the belief that Alzer was a powerful country.</p>
<p>It must be humiliating for him to recognize their defeat against the kingdom.</p>
<p>But he was also someone realistic as a politician.</p>
<p>Loic took advantage of that.</p>
<p>「──The kingdom is formidable. That’s exactly why it’s necessary for us to take a befitting attitude. Albergue-dono’s stance is a poor move for the coming negotiation.」</p>
<p>Fernand averted his face from Loic. He might have the same thinking.</p>
<p>Loic showed his card for this negotiation──it was the best possible card.</p>
<p>「──I found the priestess.」</p>
<p>Hearing that, Fernand turned toward Loic with his eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>Loic continued.</p>
<p>「There are survivors from Lespinasse House that was destroyed by Rault House in the past──they are twin sisters with the name Noelle and Lelia. Currently they are attending the academy with their surname changed.」</p>
<p>Fernand was shocked once more to hear that.</p>
<p>「I can’t believe that Albergue-dono would do such a blunder but──they actually survived.」</p>
<p>Rault House destroyed Lespinasse House.</p>
<p>That was all the young generation knew, but they weren’t told about the circumstance of that period in detail.</p>
<p>It was because the related people kept their mouth shut.</p>
<p>The current heads of the six great nobles──or their predecessor knew more about the situation at that time, but no one would say anything about it.</p>
<p>The previous head of Barriere House had died. It was also the same with Druille House.</p>
<p>There was no way to investigate what happened.</p>
<p>It was also difficult to march into another house and asked what happened.</p>
<p>But, Rault House ended up as the acting chairman.</p>
<p>A lot of the young generations were puzzled by that.</p>
<p>Loic was also curious about that.</p>
<p>(It’s unthinkable that Albergue-dono would overlook Noelle and Lelia but, is there some kind of reason for it?)</p>
<p>If one was going to destroy a house, then the heir of that house was someone that absolutely mustn’t be allowed to get away.</p>
<p>Overlooking them would mean a failure.</p>
<p>But, Loic wasn’t really interested with the circumstance around that matter.</p>
<p>What was important was that Noelle was chosen as the priestess.</p>
<p>「The one chosen as priestess is Noelle. Fernand-san, I’m──thinking to bring Noelle into Barriere House.」</p>
<p>Fernand gazed coldly at him when he heard that.</p>
<p>「If someone from that house survive and get chosen as the priestess then she should be put under the protection of all the six houses. A single house monopolizing her is out of the question.」</p>
<p>Those words were also filled with Fernand’s real motive that didn’t want to hand such large influence to Barriere House.</p>
<p>But Loic had also already prepared a compensation.</p>
<p>「About Hughes, does Fernand-san plan to have him assist you after he graduate from the academy?」</p>
<p>Fernand was suspicious because Loic suddenly changed the topic but he nodded.</p>
<p>「That’s my intention.」</p>
<p>「Hughes is a capable man even though he look frivolous like that. There won’t be any problem even if he become the head of a great noble house.」</p>
<p>Fernand strengthened his wariness.</p>
<p>「Are you planning to make Hughes the head of Druille House if I’m refusing here?」</p>
<p>「No way. You are someone necessary in order to build a strong Alzer in the future. The head of Druille House is undoubtedly Fernand-san alone. But, even Hughes is a capable talent that can act as a head of a house correct? After all that guy’s fiancée is Louise.」</p>
<p>Fernand immediately understood after hearing that.</p>
<p>「It’s useless. There is still Serge-kun.」</p>
<p>Loic snorted when Serge’s name came out.</p>
<p>「Do you really think that a man who is aiming to become something like an adventurer will really be worthy to become the head of a great noble house? Besides, that guy hates the six great nobles. Fernand-san yourself want to continue having a friendly relationship with the next head of Rault House right?」</p>
<p>And if that head was a step-brother who Fernand was close with then it wouldn’t be a bad thing for him.</p>
<p>Hughes was someone capable, but he had a side to him that was blindly devoted to Fernand.</p>
<p>Fernand was also aware of that.</p>
<p>Loic gave one more push.</p>
<p>「Hughes and Louise will be the one to succeed Rault House. No one will protest if it’s their child who succeed Rault House. ──Except the acting chairman that is.」</p>
<p>Fernand thought for a bit, and then he made his decision.</p>
<p>「Very well. I shall accept this deal. But, I shall have the priestess become the chairman after she graduate from the academy and can stand on her own. Will you promise that the chairman position shall be filled by Lespinasse House?」</p>
<p>Loic had no interest about that.</p>
<p>(He must be on guard toward Barriere House rising up as tyrant, but if I become the guardian then it will be Barriere House that stand behind Lespinasse House no matter what anyone say. Well, that will be for the future.)</p>
<p>「Of course. Well, I will be Noelle’s backer from now on as the guardian though.」</p>
<p>At the commonwealth, it wasn’t unusual for the house from where the guardian came from to hold the authority.</p>
<p>Fernand said that he wouldn’t allow Barriere House to monopolize the priestess of Lespinasse House in the future too.</p>
<p>Fernand made a pained expression.</p>
<p>His conscience must be prickling him because of his betrayal toward Albergue.</p>
<p>But, Loic didn’t pay it any mind.</p>
<p>(So being in Albergue-dono’s debt only goes this far. He immediately betray him when he learn that he’ll be able to obtain Rault House’s strength. But, I’ll have you be useful for me──Fernand)</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p>In Louise’s room that was prepared for her in Druille House’s mansion.</p>
<p>Louise was living there during her summer vacation.</p>
<p>At the surface she was here was to deepen her relationship with Hughes. It was like they were already practically married.</p>
<p>It was nothing more than a show for the other six great nobles.</p>
<p>The reason was because Rault House wanted a connection with Druille House immediately.</p>
<p>It would be troubling for Albergue who was working as the acting chairman if there wasn’t any house who would become his ally.</p>
<p>But, Hughes never visited Louise’s room.</p>
<p>The summer vacation was going for more than a month in Alzer too.</p>
<p>And yet he never visited her even once.</p>
<p>Louise saw Hughes going on in his car when she saw outside the window.</p>
<p>「She is going out to womanize again.」</p>
<p>Louise didn’t hold a grudge to him for that.</p>
<p>Because both of them were well aware that they had no feeling for each other.</p>
<p>Even though things would progress more smoothly if only he laid his hand on her already──she was only thinking that at most in regard to this.</p>
<p>Louise had nothing to do even if she stayed in her room, so she thought of going out for shopping.</p>
<p>Then she found several servants standing in front of her room.</p>
<p>「Louise-sama, where are you heading?」</p>
<p>They looked a bit flustered.</p>
<p>「I’m going out for shopping. Can I ask you to prepare a car for me?」</p>
<p>The servants looked at each other.</p>
<p>And then they immediately answered Louise.</p>
<p>「Certainly. Please wait in your room until we finished the preparation.」</p>
<p>「I’m going to ride the car in front of the entrance anyway. I’ll wait over there.」</p>
<p>「No, please wait inside your room.」</p>
<p>Louise was told to return to her room. She felt that something was strange.</p>
<p>(What’s going on? The atmosphere is different from yesterday.)</p>
<p>It felt like they were hiding something from Louise.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p>At night of that day.</p>
<p>She should have dinner together with Hughes, but he didn’t appear no matter how long she waited.</p>
<p>The servants who were serving her were also looking troubled.</p>
<p>「Hughes still hasn’t returned?」</p>
<p>One of the servants answered Louise’s question.</p>
<p>「Hughes-sama has returned, but he was summoned by Fernand-sama.」</p>
<p>「By Fernand-san?」</p>
<p>He was called even though it was time for dinner?</p>
<p>All this time Fernand was be someone who would scold Hughes instead for never taking care of Louise.</p>
<p>Was there some emergency business?</p>
<p>Hughes entered the room while she was pondering that.</p>
<p>He sat on his seat roughly and grabbed the wine bottle that a servant was holding. He poured it into his glass and started to drink.</p>
<p>Louise warned him.</p>
<p>「That’s a bad manner.」</p>
<p>Hughes was smiling.</p>
<p>Louise was curious seeing that.</p>
<p>Normally he would only reply carelessly with something like 「Right, yeah」.</p>
<p>「What’s the matter?」</p>
<p>「Louise, something interesting is going to happen after this.」</p>
<p>Hughes said that and reached out toward the dinner that the servants brought.</p>
<p>Louise didn’t understand what he meant.</p>
<p>Hughes raised his glass with an amused look.</p>
<p>「Tomorrow is going to be a good day for Alzer.」</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 7</h2>
<p>At Marie’s mansion.</p>
<p>A lot of cars were arriving in front of the gate.</p>
<p>There were soldiers wearing ceremonial uniform.</p>
<p>There were also fully armed soldiers behind them. An airship was floating in the air.</p>
<p>The mansion was surrounded from the air and the ground.</p>
<p>Kyle pointed at outside the window.</p>
<p>「Goshujin-sama, there are also more airships coming over here!」</p>
<p>Airships with different family crest were gathering.</p>
<p>They were acting like observer.</p>
<p>Cara was trembling.</p>
<p>「Marie-sama, there are even armors flying around!」</p>
<p>The mansion was surrounded.</p>
<p>This commotion was happening in the morning.</p>
<p>Marie who was still in her pajama with messy hair was hugging a pillow because she had just woken up in panic.</p>
<p>「C-calm down! At this kind of time you should pinch your cheek to ascertain whether this is a dream or not!」</p>
<p>The three pinched their cheek.</p>
<p>──It hurt. This was reality.</p>
<p>Kyle held his head with his two hands.</p>
<p>「What’re we going to do! Even though the count isn’t here right now!」</p>
<p>Cara was also the same.</p>
<p>「Uwaa~n, Count Bartfalt, return back quickly!」</p>
<p>The two of them weren’t holding any expectation for the five idiots.</p>
<p>Marie was also the same.</p>
<p>「Creare, Leon still hasn’t come back!?」</p>
<p>『H~m, there is a communication that they will return soon, but it will still take time. Yosh, let’s bring Licorne here and burn them all!』</p>
<p>Marie was terrified with Creare too.</p>
<p>(Craaap, these guys, they can kill humans without even batting an eyelid! Or rather, will it be alright even if we do something like that? It won’t become international problem? Eh, but isn’t this already a problem? Or rather, why are they attacking while big bro is absent!? ──W-wait, aren’t they attacking because big bro is absent? BIG BRO YOU STUPID IDIOOOTTTT!!)</p>
<p>Marie misunderstood that they were attacked because Leon was absent, but a messenger wearing tailcoat suit came to the mansion.</p>
<p>『Oh, are they going to declare war? Perhaps they’re thinking that Licorne isn’t as powerful as Einhorn? Then I’ll test it on you guys! I’ll proof that my Licorne is an even more capable child than Einhorn!』</p>
<p><em>I’m gonna shower them with main cannon and missiles yeah! </em>Creare was getting exultant like that. Marie pinned her down with her pillow.</p>
<p>「This idiot! It’ll be a war if you do something like that! A-anyway, let that guy enter the mansion!」</p>
<p>The messenger raised his voice while Marie was in panic.</p>
<p>「I’m a servant of Barriere House. Noelle Zel Lespinasse-sama──we have come to respectfully receive you!」</p>
<p>Marie’s eyes turned round like saucer when she heard that.</p>
<p>「H-how did these guys learn that!」</p>
<p>Marie didn’t know of any plot like this in the game.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 8</h2>
<p>When Noelle came out after her name was called, the messenger kneeled and bowed his head.</p>
<p>That person must be the one with the highest status among Barriere House’s retainers. There was a crest on the back of his right hand.</p>
<p>And then he said this in front of Noelle.</p>
<p>「I’m glad to see you safe and sound. It’s my great honor to be able to receive you the heiress of Lespinasse House.」</p>
<p>Nolle looked at the soldiers of Barriere House surrounding the mansion in a daze.</p>
<p>There were also onlookers gathering around.</p>
<p>They were looking at Noelle.</p>
<p>「Lespinasse he said!」</p>
<p>「There is a survivor from there?」</p>
<p>「Eh, but the heiress mean──the priestess!?」</p>
<p>The soldiers drove away those onlookers.</p>
<p>But, it was already become known that she was a survivor.</p>
<p>(Aa~, everything is hopeless now.)</p>
<p>Noelle looked at her right hand. Then she asked the man in front of her who said that they came to pick her up.</p>
<p>「You really come here in force. What are you planning to do with the people here?」</p>
<p>The messenger answered without raising his head.</p>
<p>「We shall stake our lives on the line for the sake of taking back the priestess. If it’s for taking back the priestess, then our only recourse is to fight even if we have to face the knight of the kingdom.」</p>
<p>Noelle looked down.</p>
<p>(Even though they know that Leon isn’t here)</p>
<p>A young man entered the gate while Noelle was rooted on the spot.</p>
<p>──It was Loic.</p>
<p>「Noelle, I come to pick you up.」</p>
<p>「Loic, you」</p>
<p>Loic looked at Barriere House’s army around him.</p>
<p>The airship wasn’t aiming its cannon here, but it was prepared to attack anytime.</p>
<p>Noelle vented her anger at Loic.</p>
<p>「Are you planning to pick a fight with these people next after Faiviel House!? Have you forgot what happened to Faiviel House? If you do something like this, Alzer will always be called as a barbaric country no matter how much time passed.」</p>
<p>Loic smiled while listening to Noel’s speech.</p>
<p>He looked really eerie.</p>
<p>Noelle got scared seeing him. Then Loic spread open his arms and spoke.</p>
<p>「That’s just how priceless you are!」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>Loic ignored the bewildered Noelle and continued talking with a transparent act.</p>
<p>「Even if we have to lose our lives, we will still fight in order to save you. It’s not just Barriere House. The other five houses will also have to fight. No──the whole country will fight for you.」</p>
<p>The priestess was that important of an existence at Alzer.</p>
<p>The priestess had been absent for more than ten years──many people were feeling uneasy from that.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the nobles, the people living in this country was feeling the same.</p>
<p>The existence that connected the people and the sacred tree.</p>
<p>The priestess was a very important existence in this country that was worshipping the sacred tree.</p>
<p>Surely a lot of people would fight in order to take Noelle back.</p>
<p>They would still fight, even if they had to face Leon who drove the commonwealth until just one step before defeat.</p>
<p>(This guy, he’s using the lives of many people as shield.)</p>
<p>This was Loic’s aim.</p>
<p>A lot of people would die if war broke out.</p>
<p>What’s more, Loic did this knowing that Noelle wouldn’t be able to bear that.</p>
<p>Loic cornered Noelle using the many people gathered here as his shield.</p>
<p>「Noelle, we will fight until the last man for you. What’re you going to do? Will you ignore our feeling──no, will you still brush off my hand?」</p>
<p>She heard the sounds of footsteps running down the stairs in hurry.</p>
<p>It was Marie and others.</p>
<p>Marie appeared with disheveled hair. It seemed she had changed clothes in a hurry.</p>
<p>Marie saw Loic and howled.</p>
<p>「This damn bastard! There are things that can be done and must not be done! Don’t get cocky just because big br──Leon isn’t here!」</p>
<p>Loic scoffed scornfully at Marie.</p>
<p>「Oo~, I’m scared. Scary, scary. There is that white Einhorn anchored at the harbor isn’t it? Surely it will also move by itself and destroy us one after another. But, even then we will fight till the very end. After all you’re Alzer’s priestess.」</p>
<p>Blood left Noelle’s face.</p>
<p>Her legs were shaking when she imagined a lot of people dying for her sake.</p>
<p>Loic approached Noelle and whispered into her ear.</p>
<p>「Noelle──become mine. That’s your destiny.」</p>
<p>「Des, tiny?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. You who are chosen as the priestess only have two paths to choose from now. Will you run and let so many die, or will you come to me and bring peace to Alzer──now, you can choose.」</p>
<p>He said that she could choose, but there was only one choice for Noelle.</p>
<p>「You are, really the worst.」</p>
<p>「I love you. If it’s for you, I’ll do anything. Can you see just how great my love is for you?」</p>
<p>Noelle raised her hand to slap him, but she immediately lost strength and lowered her hand.</p>
<p>Marie was yelling behind her.</p>
<p>「Noelle, don’t be tricked by that guy’s bullshit! Leon will arrive soon and resolve this!」</p>
<p>Loic scowled when he heard Leon’s name.</p>
<p>「Leon──Count Bartfalt huh? That guy is certainly strong. But, I wonder how far he is going to seriously fight for you? In the end he is just a foreigner. He won’t give his all for this country’s sake. Well, it doesn’t matter even if he give his all though.」</p>
<p>Would Leon stake his life to fight for her?</p>
<p>──That wouldn’t happen.</p>
<p>Leon had his own position. He also had fiancées back home.</p>
<p>There was no way he would fight Loic in order to save her.</p>
<p>And even if he would fight──Noelle didn’t want to make Leon fight.</p>
<p>(I can’t, trouble him anymore than this.)</p>
<p>Noelle turned around.</p>
<p>「Sorry, Marie-chan──I-I’m, going.」</p>
<p>Marie was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Noelle started walking. Loic stood beside her and placed his hand around her waist.</p>
<p>He roughly pulled Noelle toward him.</p>
<p>「I know that you will surely respond to our feeling, Noelle! Now, let the whole country know of the birth of our priestess! Alzer will be in peace with this!」</p>
<p>The surrounding cheered loudly seeing Loic and Noelle walking together.</p>
<p>Noelle was the only one looking down.</p>
<p>(There won’t be any problem if I endure by myself. Lelia──sorry, I got us exposed.)</p>
<p>Noelle apologized to her twin sister while entering into the car that Loic prepared.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>so here is a little fanfic i wrote based on the fact that loic is gonna put that collar on noelle.<br/>
noelle bad end:<br/>
leon comes back to the common wealth and finds out that noelle is nowhere to be found, so he asks around and when he learns the truth he turns around and whispers something to luxion after which they leave.<br/>
fast forward an appropriate amount of time(couldn’t decide on week, month or three months) and leon comes attacking alzer with an army of androids. he defeats every great house and makes them shake in their bones. then he reaches the dungeon where noelle is being kept. she starts crying when she sees him and whimpers: “we can’t be together anymore I’ve been shamed”. leon smiles bitterly and says: “I really don’t care about that but it would be cruel of me to force you to live a humiliated life”; then he pulls out a gun and aims it at noelle. noelle closes her eyes and smiles after not having done so in a long time…bang…silence…silence…silence…leon pulls the gun away and looks at it…then he points at his own head and pulls the trigger, but the gun explodes and damages his hand. he looks at luxion and says it malfunctioned to which luxion replies: “it didn’t malfunction my human overlord. the gun was made to protect mankind and it did its job right; as you can see there are no dead humans.”. after hearing that leon goes silent and lowers his gaze for some time then he looks up and says listlessly: “for thy glory”. luxion the exclaims: “FOR THE GLORY OF MANKIND.” after which the camera zooms out and we can see androids killing everyone in sight and there is a very big robot approaching from a distance with giant-tree cutting saws instead of hands(search Engels from Nier: Automata).</p>
<p>FIN.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Leon is actually a good catch huh. I’m glad a writer is finally pointing out there is more to people, and guys at that, than just good lucks or outward appearance. While Julius and the others have good looks, are physically strong, and have that generic charming personality, they aren’t dependable, resourceful, and lack so much common sense to the point of causing more harm than good. In addition, they completely disregarded and threw their beautiful fiances while Leon tries his hardest not to piss of his.</p>
