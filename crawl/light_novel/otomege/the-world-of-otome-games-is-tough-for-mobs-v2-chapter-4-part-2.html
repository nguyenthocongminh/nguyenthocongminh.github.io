<div class="entry-content">
<p>When the race was approaching its final stage, the participants started moving away from me in order to raise their ranking.</p>
<p>“Is this enough?”</p>
<p>“Now that we’ve beaten him up this much, he shouldn’t be able to run anymore.”</p>
<p>“See ya, blabbermouth!”</p>
<p>Watching the backs of the blockheads as they left, I gripped the handle and turned up the throttle, causing the engine to greatly rumble.</p>
<p>The body of the airbike was battered, and the visor of my helmet fractured──but my heart hadn’t broken.</p>
<p>How unfortunate for these trash heaps! Not finishing me off would be their undoing!</p>
<p>“──Shall we go, Luxon?”</p>
<p>[Whenever you’re ready. However, it’s strange that that the referee didn’t intervene despite the amount of open rough play that happened. Aren’t you being hated on a little too much?]</p>
<p>“I should have bribed the referee with some money.”</p>
<p>[You really come up with the worst ideas. However, I think the other students have already done some bribing, so the referee probably wouldn’t comply unless you offer more money than them.]</p>
<p>“If it’s money, then I have more than I could possibly need! However, my heart won’t yield even in the face of this kind of injustice!”</p>
<p>The boys who had surrounded me not too long ago were now competing against each other. As I increased the speed, I broke up the commotion.</p>
<p>I then passed them.</p>
<p>The airbike was in its best condition after Luxon had taken control over it.</p>
<p>Despite my skill, I was able to easily overtake the participants.</p>
<p>“Y, you!”</p>
<p>I waved my hand towards the boys, who seemed irritated.</p>
<p>“I’ll commend you people for trying to stop me. As expected from you all, it amounted to so little, idiots!”</p>
<p>As I passed through each and every participant, I began to run into Clarice’s followers, who had been monopolizing the lead. Different from the others, they seemingly wanted to share the lead with each other.</p>
<p>[They’re pretty fast, aren’t they.]</p>
<p>“Can we catch up to them?”</p>
<p>[What a funny joke──it won’t take even a minute to pass them.]</p>
<p>Once the engine began to work past its limits, merely holding onto the airbike became a tough task.</p>
<p>The control of the airbike was done by Luxon. All I could do was frantically cling onto the bike whenever it swayed or leaned over.</p>
<p>[Master, you’re a bit late on shifting your weight. To say it plainly, you’re bothersome to work with.]</p>
<p>“You’re making too many back and forth movements! Also, don’t call me bothersome! You’re going to make me cry.”</p>
<p>I moved my body according to the motions of the bike, and passed the participants in the lead one after the other.</p>
<p>The venue was in an uproar after seeing that. The announcer shouted, perhaps in astonishment as well.</p>
<p>“W, who would have thought that Baltfault would be competing for the lead now! Is this even possible? Could it be that he has done some illegal modifications?!”</p>
<p>Did they really hate seeing me win?</p>
<p>“I see. In that case, I’ll win no matter what.”</p>
<p>I definitely wanted to see their tear-stained faces by all means.</p>
<p>When I passed the the participant in third place, the one in second appeared in front of me.</p>
<p>“Let’s see you get through this!”</p>
<p>Blocking the direction I was moving in, the participant smiled while saying so.</p>
<p>“Sorry! I’m about to get through right now~!”</p>
<p>Once I shifted my body along with the airbike and bypassed the participant in second using some very tricky moves, the only one in front of me was him──the third-year upperclassman.</p>
<p>When I tried to pass him through the outer track, the upperclassman made a beeline to the goal instead of trying to do something to me──a race to the goal without any pointless nonsense.</p>
<p>I had already seen that he was the type that hated doing cheap tricks, but this affirmed it.</p>
<p>“──Sorry.”</p>
<p>When a fire sprouted from the muffler of the airbike Luxon was controlling, the airbike took a speed that frightened me.</p>
<p>──While sensing this speed which made me reluctant to do an airbike race again, my airbike had reached the goal first.</p>
<p>I had won.</p>
<p>Once the speed of the airbike lowered and I took off my helmet, I faced the stadium with a smile and raised my hand.</p>
<p>“Eveyone, I won~! Sorry~.”</p>
<p>Objects were being thrown from audience seats.</p>
<p>“You again!”</p>
<p>“Give me back my money!”</p>
<p>“You pest!”</p>
<p>I waved my hand when hearing such vocal cheering. Their faces of irritation were my biggest reward.</p>
<p>[Master.]</p>
<p>“What? I’m enjoying the situation right now, so leave me be.”</p>
<p>[No, this thing is at its limit.]</p>
<p>“──Huh?”</p>
<p>When I turned around, I saw white fumes coming from the airbike. I did indeed think that my back was feeling a little hot. It felt like the seat, or rather the whole airbike itself, was hot.</p>
<p>“Aaaah!”</p>
<p>When I grabbed Luxon and was about to take a leap of faith off of the airbike, the upperclassman drove up to me from behind and picked me up.</p>
<p>The upperclassman had a gentle expression, but also seemed like he was going to sob.</p>
<p>“You really saved me.”</p>
<p>When I gave my appreciation to him, the upperclassman made a smile that seemed as if he was troubled.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. You really gave me a shock back when that duel happened. Thank you for what you did back then. I was also able to earn a little cash because of it.”</p>
<p>It seemed that this upperclassman hated Jilk and made a bet on me during the duel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">◇</p>
<p>We were in the medical office.</p>
<p>Now that I had been awarded, I came to Jilk and the others while carrying the prize money.</p>
<p>I showed off my medal while looking at Marie’s frustrated expression.</p>
<p>I wonder why it felt so nice.</p>
<p>It was a refreshing feeling that I hadn’t felt in a long time, similar to when I would talk down my younger sister.</p>
<p>“Lookie here, I won. You didn’t forget your promise, right Jilk~?”</p>
<p>Jilk made a sigh while looking at my grinning face.</p>
<p>“Yes, a promise is a promise. I’ll do anything you want. I’ll comply as long as it remains within my limits.”</p>
<p>He said for it to remain within his limits, but that indicated how black-hearted he was.</p>
<p>He was saying that he wouldn’t do anything he didn’t want to do.</p>
<p>What a terrible person.</p>
<p>This was why these otome game capture targets were the worst.</p>
<p>“So what are you planning on having him do? Have him do a handstand nude?”</p>
<p>Kyle, with his hands clasped behind his head, spoke frankly towards me. Wasn’t his attitude a little overbearing for someone who knew that I was a baron?</p>
<p>“Are you an idiot? What value is there in having him do a handstand? No wait, there’s some value if he exposes his nude self in front of the girls. I could make a profit from it.”</p>
<p>Thereupon, Marie pointed at me.</p>
<p>“So you’d go that far just to get money! You cheapskate!”</p>
<p>“Go take a look in the mirror! You’ll find a bigger cheapskate than me!”</p>
<p>“More importantly, hand over the prize money!”</p>
<p>She really was shameless. I thought it would have been fine to divide the prize money, since it was indeed thanks to Jilk that I was able to compete in the final race. However, I decided to give Marie the full amount, just as she wished.</p>
<p>“Alright. Take it.”</p>
<p>“H, how awfully compliant of you.”</p>
<p>“You could say it’s my saving grace.”</p>
<p>Once I handed over the prize money of three hundred thousand dia, Marie jumped at it. However, she seemed curious about the white gold coin that I had. I fiddled around with the white gold coin in my hand to purposely show it off.</p>
<p>“T, that’s a white gold coin, right? Why do you have such a thing?”</p>
<p>“It’s the profit I made with today’s bet. I made a bet on myself, and since I was an unexpected winner, I made some large gains.”</p>
<p>When Marie watched as I swapped the white gold coin in my hand for gold coins and silver coins, Marie trembled. I had a hunch that this would make her envious, and it seemed that I was right on the mark.</p>
<p>The amount of money I had in my hand outshined three hundred thousand dia.</p>
<p>“C, coward. How unfair! Betting on yourself shouldn’t be allowed!”</p>
<p>“I see no problem with it. You all should be satisfied with the amount of money you got.”</p>
<p>When I acted as if three hundred thousand dia was of no concern, it seemed that Marie was genuinely irritated. It really was easy to read this person.</p>
<p>When a furious Marie glared at me, Jilk stood up.</p>
<p>Were his injuries okay?</p>
<p>“I understand. So it’s no problem what I do as long as it makes you feel better.”</p>
<p>I looked away from Marie as if I didn’t care about her, and turned to face Jilk.</p>
<p>“How foolish. If I just let you do as I please, Anjie and Livia would likely get angry. I’ve decided to give you a more realistic order. Actually, I suppose I could call it a request.”</p>
<p>Jilk looked at me with a doubtful gaze. Did he really have that little trust in me?</p>
<p>“A request?”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">◇</p>
<p>The academy was filled with sorrow after the festival.</p>
<p>Tools were each taken out from school buildings, beginning the cleanup.</p>
<p>Now that the three days of the festival were over, it finally felt like everything had come to an end.</p>
<p>I was in my cafe, beginning to put away the utensils.</p>
<p>Also in there were Jilk, Clarice, and her followers.</p>
<p>Jilk was wearing a hospital gown and had his head and arm wrapped in bandages.</p>
<p>Clarice stood in front of such a pathetic-looking Jilk.</p>
<p>This was part of my request for Jilk.</p>
<p>“I’m truly sorry about the matter.”</p>
<p>An apology towards Clarice.</p>
<p>Before coming here, I also allowed my older sister to apologize. That matter was not as important as this one, though.</p>
<p>Clarice had teary eyes.</p>
<p>“You’re late for only doing it now at this point! I had been waiting! Did you really think that you could erase everything between us with just a single letter?”</p>
<p>Clarice was furious.</p>
<p>That was natural. Jilk should reflect on this matter.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about how I fell for someone else, and the matter of our marriage. I don’t want to lie, especially not in front of your face. The fact of the matter is that I’m in love with another woman.”</p>
<p>Clarice took a step forward and slapped Jilk in an instant.</p>
<p>What a nice sound it made within the room.</p>
<p>Do it some more! Go on, Clarice!</p>
<p>Jilk didn’t talk back. However, it seemed that he was prepared to accept whatever came his way. He should’ve used the bravery he had here for something else.</p>
<p>“What is there to lie about?! You were seduced by that woman. Did you want to abandon me that much? Why that girl?! Why…am I not good enough?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know myself. However, I do know that I fell in love with her. Due to that, I was hesitant in seeing you.”</p>
<p>No matter how cruel an excuse was, it sounded better when said by someone good-looking.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that Jilk didn’t want to meet her because it was just plain troublesome for him. If I did something bad to a woman and gave an excuse like that, everyone around me would go “What did you just say?” and treat me coldly.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, what kind of excuse would I make? No wait, I wouldn’t even be in an affair to begin with. In an otome game world like this, a guy cheating on another would result in them being tracked down and beaten up. On the other hand, a woman doing it would end with just a slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>This world really was unreasonable.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to deceive me again? Jilk, you’re always like that! You’ve never spoken towards me once about what you truly think! Even now, aren’t you just trying to escape by pretending to apologize?”</p>
<p>“These are my honest feelings. I’m not in a position to meet you. Even just us meeting could drag you down. That being the case, I wish that you could remember me as you had before.”</p>
<p>Although Jilk was a capture target, he basically was a troublesome person who wouldn’t speak to others about his thoughts. He would always grin, but never would talk about what he liked or disliked.</p>
<p>Thus, he would try to run away from things he didn’t like, making him a truly troublesome guy. I suppose that according to the game, the reason for it was for the sake of Julian. However, this was a matter of apologizing to his ex-fiancee!</p>
<p>Clarice’s followers were about to ready their weapons in their hands.</p>
<p>When I assessed that the situation wasn’t looking good and was about to intervene, Clarice spoke.</p>
<p>“──Stand down.”</p>
<p>“My lady?”</p>
<p>The third-year upperclassman was concerned about Clarice. Clarice wiped her tears.</p>
<p>“There’s no point in dirtying your hands. I have nothing to do with this man anymore. He’s just a stranger from now on. I don’t want to get involved with him again.”</p>
<p>Jilk lowered his head, although it seemed like he wanted to say something about the fight that almost broke out.</p>
<p>“My apologies. And, thank you, Clarice.”</p>
<p>Clarice hung her head and gritted her teeth.</p>
<p>“Don’t speak to me so casually! I don’t want to see your face anymore!”</p>
<p>Jilk left the room as he was told to do. H, huh? Didn’t that mean I was the only one left here?</p>
<p>When a nervous atmosphere covered the room, the third-year upperclassman spoke up.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. We inconvenienced you.”</p>
<p>“N, not at all.”</p>
<p>Clarice sat on a chair that her followers brought and began to cry.</p>
<p>I wanted to go home.</p>
<p>“I’m heading off as well. I probably shouldn’t be here.”</p>
<p>“No, wait for a moment.”</p>
<p>When he said that, all of the boys around bowed their heads. I was in surprise, imagining that they were about to beat me up.</p>
<p>“W, what?!”</p>
<p>“Even when we tried calling him, he wouldn’t come. We have to thank you, Baron. We’re sorry for the numerous rude things we did!”</p>
<p>“We’re sorry!”</p>
<p>Speaking plainly, this was a situation where a first-year student like me was being surrounded by upperclassmen who were bowing their heads. It was kind of frightening. I wasn’t sure why I was scared!</p>
<p>I was puzzled by all of the boys making an apology, and when I took a bit of distance, I noticed that there were sub-race slaves simply watching us.</p>
<p>Servants had no devotion. Their relationships were purely contractual.</p>
<p>“If you’re not satisfied, I don’t mind if you hit me. Do whatever you need to do. However, leave my lady unrelated to this matter.”</p>
<p>“Will that really do?”</p>
<p>The upperclassman made a small smile when I made that mean-spirited comment.</p>
<p>“If that won’t do, then I’ll take responsibility. I’ll offer my life.”</p>
<p>He would take responsibility with his life, he said? That really was frightening. I was jealous that there were people who had this much loyalty to others.</p>
<p>When hearing that, Clarice stood up.</p>
<p>“Wait! Do you think I would allow that? This is entirely my responsibility. You all were just following my orders. That’s all you did.”</p>
<p>“But, my lady!”</p>
<p>I spoke in amazement when seeing them argue over who should take responsibility.</p>
<p>“How about stopping this emotional drama? Trying to figure out who should take responsibility is troublesome, so no thanks. I hate having to deal with troublesome things.”</p>
<p>Thereupon, the upperclassman looked at me.</p>
<p>“Y, you──err, is that so? Are you going to forgive us?”</p>
<p>Did they think I was here to drive Clarice into a corner? In the first place, Jilk was the one in the wrong. If he had actually taken the proper course of action, this matter would have been resolved before it even began.</p>
<p>He really was a troublesome guy.</p>
<p>“Clarice, you should get back on your feet. There are as many stars as there are men out there.”</p>
<p>Clarice hung her head and made a feeble smile towards what I said.</p>
<p>“You’re twisted, but you’re pretty kind, aren’t you.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Luxon was saying [She’s mistaken. Master, you’re not twisted, but rather crooked beyond repair──] and other such trivial things, so I took a look at the exclusive servants.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk as if you know my feelings. I’m just grateful that these troublesome things will end.”</p>
<p>“Is that so. He’s too late anyways. I’ve already been sullied.”</p>
<p>Behind Clarice, who was making a sorrowful smile, I noticed one of her exclusive servants making a telling grin. It was a smile that spoke as if they had won.</p>
<p>“Rest assured. A good woman like you need not concern herself with being sullied. However, you should do something about those exclusive slaves of yours.”</p>
<p>When I glared back at the sub-race exclusive servants, each of them had a flustered expression. To them, Clarice was a good master.</p>
<p>Another way to put it was that she was reasonable.</p>
<p>They didn’t want to part with their master, a girl who gave them a good pay, so they seemed panicked.</p>
<p>“How fair-spoken. Perhaps this was how you gained favor with Anjelica.”</p>
<p>“It’s because I’m an honest man who tells no lies.”</p>
<p>The upperclassman disregarded that by saying “That’s definitely a lie.”</p>
<p>Clarice slightly nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Alright. I’ll try to keep doing my best. I’m already tired of living like this. Seriously, I understand that I can’t make him turn my way no matter what I do. I wonder what I had been doing.”</p>
<p>Jilk was also a sinful man. That was just my assessment of him, but he did throw everything away just for the sake of Marie.</p>
<p>She really was a good-for-nothing reincarnated person. In order to realize her reverse harem, she caused the suffering of many others.</p>
<p>Imagine if there were an honest and gentle women who would play around with a man. The reason being that she wanted the man, who had been abandoned by others, to look her way──why couldn’t there have been a girl like that for me?!</p>
<p>In the end, I ended up having to clean up after Jilk’s mess──how frustrating!</p>
<p>Normally, it would have been okay if I didn’t get involved in this. However, Jilk was one of the capture targets. I wanted to avoid causing extra troubles arising from this matter. This was just a matter of looking after myself.</p>
<p>The rest was as Julian said it was. This wasn’t for Clarice’s sake.</p>
<p>I intervened because of circumstances that were larger than Jilk himself.</p>
<p>Clarice began to cry again, and since my business was done, I was about to leave. I was the one who wanted to cry. I gained nothing from today in terms of searching for marriage. The only thing I got from the school festival was enough money to build a mansion.</p>
<p>Huh? Wasn’t that pretty good? I earned a fortune at the school festival.</p>
<p>Thereupon, Clarice raised her voice.</p>
<p>“Leon. You’d better go to Anjie. It seemed that a lot had happened with Anjie and that honor student.”</p>
<p>Did something happen between them?</p>

<p>Last book was forced, this book was even more so. The hates for the betting was nonsense. People don’t usually hate overperforming side, but the underperforming one. And Leon has no real reason to force his marriage. The only reason was to maintain reputation and social standing, which he doesn’t seem to care. The incident with the girls bullying him in his cafe was ridiculous. It was not ‘gentleman’ in any way to endure the abuse. Standing in for the race was nonsense. It was individual competition, not team. Injured individual would be retired/forfeit from the race and no replacement was needed. And Angie-Livia conflict was poorly executed and would be easily solved, since they didn’t really owe anything to each other, calling them pet-master relationship was nonsense.</p>

<p>A forced setting is often used to direct the plot to the intended one. Also, not all authors are good writers you know? Most of them are not. So dont hope you will always get good book and save your crap for other things pls.</p>

<p>Some of your argument is agreeable like the the substitute but others I can not agree.</p>
<p>For the hating for the bet, you forgot to take ‘social position’ into consideration. On one side is the next generation of the ruling class (Royalty, Military, etc) and the other is the lowest class in their social structure within their section. Of course it make more sense to hate the 5 idiots for losing and make them lost bet but they can’t really do anything to them due to their birth right. Meanwhile even if they beat up Leon, he can’t really do anything back. Between a CEO’s son and a manager, it make more sense to take it out on the manager, right? Next is the ‘gentleman’ part of getting beat up. Try image back to when woman still have not much right and swap the man and woman, that is Leon’s situation. At that time, even if man beat up their wife, people don’t really bat an eye. Same thing to this Otome world, just in reverse. The marriage is like how it’s necessary to make identification in our world. You don’t really care if the government have your data or not but if you don’t register by a certain age then they might come for you. Between a force marriage and a chosen one, latter is better. Lastly, the Anji-Livia conflict. I’s like how a high income family trying to be friend with a homeless person. Even if the family is sincere, the homeless would still don’t really believe them in a shot time, right? It seem impossible from normal view like why would they want to associate with the homeless normally? In this regard, Anjie-Livia relationship of noble-commoner is like that. It doesn’t make sense from normal people perspective.</p>

<p>It would make sense for the usual resident of that world. But Leon was against that norm. Yet, he reluctantly follows some of them while also anger and go against most in the student body. So does he actually care how others look at him or not?</p>
<p>And he is in the ‘high nobility’ (Baron is actually a high nobility. It was an  entry rank for high nobility, but still.), or middle nobility as this novel would say, with backing of another developing barony, possibly a Duke family, and finally the direct vassalage to the king. (The novel didn’t specified his direct liege. He might be a direct vassal to the king). He has sufficient power to at least defend against obvious abuse/wrongdoings against him.</p>
<p>And this story made it seems like large number of students are actually very hurt by betting against him and hold a grudge. But realistically, how many would actually place a bet with no financial leeway? How many would even be capable of making a debt so large their family cannot handle? And then bet again?</p>
<p>As for Angie-Livia, it is normal for outsiders view, but they didn’t actually have such relationship, nor does Angie even pay or gift Livia any wealth. So it can be resolved easily. Hell, Angie can even be a realreal pa to Livia alnd it won’t be wrong.</p>

<p>Realistically, the comparison we’re making in the bet is like saying some random bloke off the street can beat 5 Usain Bolts in a race, in a row, 1 at a time, without much rest in between. You don’t know much about this random bloke, but hes never stood out before or anything, whereas these 5 Usain Bolts have been making headlines for their skill and are famous in all manner of categories. So…yea…when it comes to wealthy heirs and nobles in power, betting vast sums on the obvious winner in a very one sided and unfair match is quite natural. Nor are any of their families in significant trouble over it. Some took out loans and whatnot to bet even more, yes, but its not like hes sinking houses through that. Their parents just punished their kids by cutting their allowance basically, since their kids wasted a lot of money pointlessly. In universe, quite a bit of time has passed since then already anyway so its not like they haven’t had time to sort out their finances in other ways (ie by doing part time stuff or by limiting their expenses till their parents forgive them). As for being able to make such big bets….high nobles. Heirs. etc. They’ve got power and wealth and they flaunt it openly. Ofc they’ve got a ton to throw around.</p>

<p>This is a good explanation as whole so i will add some.  Leon really care about “reputation and social standing” precisely he didn’t want any of that, as matter of fact he tries to eliminate it that ended up failed spectacularly, so he stuck with it and he can’t ignore and must preserve it.  </p>
<p>The caffe incident he has no choice in that situation because feminism extreme in this world. Try to do anything to a girl and you’re finish.  Standing up for the race is simple, its grades representative and it’s final race.  That’s why earlier Angie and Livia is worried if Leon want to participate but can’t because theres full. Angie-Livia conflict is common in nobles fantasy story, is okay if Livia having title like Leon lover/mistress but they just hang out as friends.</p>

<p>You, and the story, are speaking in circles.   “Leon must preserve his reputation because it is necessary to gain an appropriate marriage,” called on one side while on the other you state, “Leon must marry an appropriate girl to preserve his reputation.”</p>
<p>It absolutely doesn’t matter what their society demands of him.  Leon despises the nation and their social obligations anyway.   He has the economic and military capacity to simply ignore them outright.   At any moment he could grab his little brother and leave for greener pastures.  There are other nations that Leon has admitted knowledge of already.</p>

<p>It has been said until eternity that the world had lackluster setting, Leon knows that, and is learning about the truth of it, or more that he is deep in it, he has the chains called family, and because of that, if he does something that upsets them in a splendorous manner, like beating up servants, he would hold liable and would be chasticed, people hate him since they were idiot gamblers who undermined a guy that had done real stuff like going by his own to find a place, be appointed as a knight and be promoted in the royal court and earn an independent nobility title, the thing is too that only those affected by losing in such a ridiculous manner hate him, other guys most likely see him as a hero after he spoke up in their behalf when he criticized prince going typical “i didnt wanna be born here, you guys have it better wuahh”, even Luxon in the interlude finds weird how tho there are fewer man compared to women, women still are on top, and counting too how the queen reacted to the academy environment and how anjie even at start only kept appareance about commoners and was disgusted by the other girls of low rank, and even Leon mother that is pretty kind and his sister that is a greedy pig, there is something weird about certain rank and below girls, and about anjie-livia, i would say it comes forth that their value senses are way different, and livia since being along with leon and lost her position as main heroine of the world, has been ever shier than what she was shown in game, making her dependant on leon and anjie, as how livia holds leon as her ideal knight as seeing chaps before, so being told that she is getting ahead of herself in an environment that naturally is out of her reach, even when she deeply knows its false, takes its toll on her, more so since anjie is still in a tough spot of change after the duel and being thrown out by the the prince and that she has become more gloomy because of it and that she had to act that way since was the only way since all before was “for the prince”, refering again to when livia sent anjie the presents that were the common rule among girls and when she spoke with her she treated her well but met her in a secretive manner without any follower</p>

<p>I’m still waiting for Luxon to get pissed enough and explain just how much of a mob the world is making him. He obsesses over finding a wife of his social standing, he keep sabotaging  himself and ends up helping his reincarnated sister, and its just pathetic  that despite all his pissing and moaning, he still acts like a mob. </p>
<p>Luxon could literally take over the kingdom and he is hosting tea parties for bitches that literally spit on him. Luxon was right, this world should be destroyed.</p>

<p>Absolutely true. Most pathetic thing is that it could be easly resolved by making the Leon normal guy, who wants to blend in the new world and is trying to accept reality. But no, he must be contradictory Marty Stu, like any other Jap character.</p>

<div class="comment-content">
<p>He doesn’t care about his own rep or standing. However, the issue comes from the fact that it implicates his birth parents and his brothers. He doesn’t give a rat’s ass about their actual standing or nobility, nor about his dad’s noble wife or their kids. What he cares about is not letting those formality issues do any harm to his actual parents and brothers. The family members he actually likes. </p>
<p>As for the betting thing, people hate him since hes also an asshole about it. He made no pretenses throughout the duel and just openly acted like the asshole he admits he himself is to all 5 guys, all of whom are high nobility and very popular among the students for many reasons (ability, looks, social standing, whatever). And he himself isn’t exactly a looker or interesting to the students en masse anyway. So its not like they would let it slide when they ended up betting everything they had on the “obvious” winners in a 5v1. </p>
<p>Girls bullying in cafe. Goes back to the marriage thing to some extent, but he also had no justification or rebuttal to refute them with. They needed business one way or another and whatever they were doing to him he didn’t mind as long as they paid. Hence ofc as soon as he had valid justification to go nuts against them (the queen appearing and being on his side so to speak) he took it immediately and roughed up the girls’ servants. </p>
<p>Standing in for the race was more for Angie than anyone else. Its individual, not team competition, yes, but the custom seems to be that every year and class group has to send a participant, as you do in school festivals. Someone had to volunteer or nominate a replacement for Jilk, and it got pushed onto Angie and him. He didn’t want to have Angie’s reputation lowered even if its from a stupidly petty thing like that, so he kind of had to step in regardless. </p>
<p>Angie-Livia conflict is due to others’ perceptions, Livia only just suddenly realizing from others that Angie used to look down on commoners, as well as them both being reminded of the differences in their status. They got along because “shit happened” but they’re normally on 2 opposite scales, one being a commoner and the other being a high noble. Its clearly not meant to be a super large issue to begin with considering that it seems they make up very quickly anyway so its not much of a problem if its addressed and solved quickly. The pet-master thing is again from other nobles’ perception since Angie clearly favors Livia a lot more lately. Theres not meant to be any logic or basis behind it, its just a taunt and an insult. </p>
<p>I agree with you that its a bit forced in places, ofc it is, no series ever really flows from start to finish without anything at all in it being forced, and most series have a lot of forced things here and there. What matters is if the storys enjoyable, flows well chronologically and can be made sense of. Theres enough in-universe setup to justify to an adequate degree literally every example of something being “nonsense” or “ridiculous”, and theres a clear motive for everything so it doesn’t warrant this sort of criticism at least. But hey, if your standards are so high I’d love to get some recommendations from you. Just so I can see what these magical series you’re reading are that aren’t forced.</p>

<p>Don’t feel like making a point by point argument, but your rationalization for the cafe debacle is just stupid.  You’re claiming that he let them smash up the place, beat him, and destroy his highly expensive tea service sets because he needed the money from their purchase of a cup of tea.  Because expenses don’t exist and sales are always pure profit, amirite?</p>

<p>Thanks for the chapter. </p>
<p>This sentence:<br/>
“Is that so. It has already gotten late. My clothes are dirty as well.”</p>
<p>I read the raw, using google translate and somehow interpret it such :<br/>
“Is that so. But its too late now. My body is already dirty”. Or something along those line. We could relate it with how her slaves grinning (because maybe they feel like a winner because they got to sleep or dirtying her) and Leon is envious that Clarice playing around with men to gain Jilk’s attention.<br/>
But you more adept in japanese than me and google translate. So maybe its just in me. Thanks again</p>
