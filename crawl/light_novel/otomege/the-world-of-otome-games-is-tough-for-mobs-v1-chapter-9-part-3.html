<div class="entry-content">
<p>When I entered the arena, my sister was no longer there.</p>
<p>Well, I was grateful that I didn’t have to talk with her. I didn’t know what I would discuss with her, other than about the bomb, but…it was installed secretly.</p>
<p>Anjelica was watching Jilk’s green armor standing in the arena.</p>
<p>“Oh look, I’ve kept my opponent waiting. It seems that things are finally getting serious.”</p>
<p>Jilk came out with equipment that made it look like he was going to a battlefield.</p>
<p>As I entered my armor, Luxon made a report to me.</p>
<p>[It seems to be the type that detonates in response to a specific magic.]</p>
<p>Bombs like these were a means of attack in the game as well. I didn’t use them, though.</p>
<p>“Guys like Jilk are the most frightening type. He excels in his marksmanship, but he’s also an all-rounder with average or excellent abilities in other fields. He can adapt no matter the situation.”</p>
<p>Julian is better in close range battles, while Jilk is a character that triumphs in long range ones. He had no peculiarities, was easy to work with, and was excellent. He was a reliable character in the game.</p>
<p>Well, he was also an irritating character who had a high degree of difficulty in capturing him.</p>
<p>Getting down onto the arena, Jilk voiced out.</p>
<p>“──You’re strong. I’ll give you my respect for that.”</p>
<p>“Why yes, thank you.”</p>
<p>Once the referee signaled that it had begun, Jilk aimed a rifle in his right hand towards me. He soared into the air from the onset and pulled the trigger without any hesitation while throwing a grenade.</p>
<p>[It’s a smokescreen.]</p>
<p>“It seems he’s not playing around.”</p>
<p>My surroundings were wrapped in a white smoke.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">◇</p>
<p>In the white smoke, Jilk soared up until he reached as high up as he could.</p>
<p>Since flying too high results in disqualification, he flew up to the very limit of what he was allowed to, and decided to attack by using his rifle and grenades from overhead.</p>
<p>“I hope that he’ll go down with this.”</p>
<p>He played a hand that he didn’t want to use that much.</p>
<p>He reached out to Leon’s sister and handed her a bomb. He didn’t give it to her directly, but instead had a schoolboy be the middleman.</p>
<p>If the matter became public, it wouldn’t hurt Julian’s reputation, and it would just be seen as a schoolboy acting rashly while worrying about Julian.</p>
<p>The arena was encased in smoke, but a magic circle appeared before Jilk. Inside it, Leon’s figure showed up, which was what Jilk was looking for.</p>
<p>“You’re a danger. I will dispose of you here.”</p>
<p>He pulled the trigger of the rifle.</p>
<p>His rifle was used by the military, and had the ability to pierce through armor. Taking it out during a duel within the academy wouldn’t garner much respect, but his opponent was Leon.</p>
<p>He couldn’t say that he was able to play it safe after his opponent had flaunted an overwhelming difference in ability so far.</p>
<p>“…Your life ended the moment you went against his Highness. I will give you a spectacular finish here!”</p>
<p>The bullet hit Leon’s armor, specifically the head.</p>
<p>It was clearly a shot meant to take his life.</p>
<p>However──</p>
<p>“W, what?!”</p>
<p>Leon looked up at the sky as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>He showed off by waving while looking calm.</p>
<p>“Tsk!”</p>
<p>He threw a grenade and readied his rifle. He loaded a bullet into the bolt action mechanism, and fired.</p>
<p>Jilk had used his last resort, resulting in the calmly standing armor in front of him getting wrapped up in an explosion. In order to activate the explosive he had set, he released a specific magic towards Leon. The magic itself had no meaning, but its reaction with the bomb caused a large explosion on Leon’s back.</p>
<p>“He’ll take damage from this direct hit!”</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t find Leon’s figure within the arena. It did not seem like he had disintegrated, it just looked like he had disappeared altogether.</p>
<p>“Where is he? Where the hell is he?!”</p>
<p>Then, Jilk felt a sense of discomfort when a shadow, one that could block the sun, quickly appeared. There was not a single cloud in the sky, though.</p>
<p>When he looked up, he saw Leon’s figure in the rear.</p>
<p>“Yo.”</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>He readied his rifle while Leon took a nose dive and headed towards him.</p>
<p>He pulled the trigger, but even though it was a shot to the armor at point-blank, the bullet was repelled.</p>
<p>“How did you withstand that explosion?”</p>
<p>“What a heavy blow that was. If you catch my drift.<em>” (TLN: I was a bit confused on what the MCs double meaning was here. Apparently, he was implying that he knew the blow was a lethal one. Thanks, Emperor Shazik)</em></p>
<p>Jilk, realizing that what he said hinted at multiple meanings, then took out his battleaxe and swung it. Leon stopped it with his shovel, and Jilk began to talk to him while not letting the audience hear.</p>
<p>“──You know nothing.”</p>
<p>“Look in mirror and say that. You are not sane.”</p>
<p>“Do you plan on dueling with his Highness? Your life as a noble will end.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine! The advanced class makes me want to throw up! I’d do anything to be free from it…and be free from people like you!”</p>
<p>Ordinary boys could sympathize with what he said. Even though they weren’t too fond of him, they would somehow find room to leave that aside when starting a conversation about their troubles.</p>
<p>However, contrary to what Leon said, he showed willpower.</p>
<p>Marie’s face popped up in Jilk’s head.</p>
<p>What a marvelous woman she was. She understood him quite well, and seemed like his own ideal woman.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for him to become obsessed with her.</p>
<p>She was not from the royal palace. Unlike the usual girls around him, she made his heart feel at ease.</p>
<p>“For the first time! I’ve come across my ideal woman!”</p>
<p>“Great, that means I have one less competitor to deal with. You can go enjoy yourself playing around with love to your heart’s content.”</p>
<p>When he received an attack from Leon’s shovel using his rifle, the rifle flew out from his hands and onto the floor.</p>
<p>(The difference in power…is too big.)</p>
<p>Julian’s face also popped up in his mind.</p>
<p>The figure of his close friend, who would look delighted when talking about Marie.</p>
<p>“What do you know?! His Highness and I truly love her! It’s not like I need to monopolize her. I just want to make her happy!”</p>
<p>“In that case, how would you feel about giving up?”</p>
<p>Leon seemed dispassionate, but each and every blow of his was heavy.</p>
<p>The armor Jilk was operating would creak each time it received a blow, as if it were screaming.</p>
<p>“I will use whatever I can to not lose to you. If you plan on doing anything to his Highness, I will risk everything I have to make sure that you──no, your family will pay!”</p>
<p>He was just like someone in love.</p>
<p>He was sad at first, and thought about giving up…but it wouldn’t be love if he gave up with just that much.</p>
<p>Jilk was prepared to do anything for the sake of not himself, but for Julian and Marie.</p>
<p>“…Such threats are cowardly when in a duel.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead and say whatever you want.”</p>
<p>The two were fighting in the sky, and the audience in the arena couldn’t hear their voices.</p>
<p>Jilk felt something happening, and when he was trying to figure it out──</p>
<p>“‘I will use whatever I can to not lose to you. If you plan on doing anything to his Highness, I will risk everything I have to make sure that you──no, your family will pay!'”</p>
<p>──He heard what he had said just a moment ago.</p>
<p>“W, what?”</p>
<p>Jilk was soon confused.</p>
<p>He had never heard of such a magic like this. Perhaps it existed and he just didn’t know about it, and maybe it was newly discovered.</p>
<p>He thought it was Leon mimicking his voice, but it seemed different from that.</p>
<p>Leon began playing back the conversation they had.</p>
<p>Jilk clenched his teeth in regret.</p>
<p>“You threatened me just a moment ago. So, I decided to threaten you as well. Let’s see, I can take this over to your household. I wonder what your family would think. Threatening someone when it seemed that you were going to lose in a duel would be tantamount to ending your life as a noble! Ah, on second thought, I wonder what your beloved Highness and Marie would think if they heard this? They would definitely scorn you. No wait, they would definitely report this to the academy! Then, all of the students in the whole school would hear about it!”</p>
<p>Jilk soon reorganized his feelings.</p>
<p>“T, that voice alone isn’t proof.”</p>
<p>In this world, there weren’t any machines or magic mechanisms that could record a voice yet. Due to that, it would be difficult to vouch for this as being evidence. It would be difficult, but there was another factor to consider.</p>
<p>“You doubt that this could be used as evidence, isn’t that right? Even so, everyone would think that my household is suffering from stress. They’ll think ‘That guy really did something to them.’ Then, wouldn’t everyone also start doubting his Highness? They would think ‘Could it be that his Highness does these kinds of things?!’ The reputation of your beloved Highness would sink.”</p>
<p>While Leon continued on in a happy manner, Jilk pretended to be as calm as possible.</p>
<p>He endured Leon’s firece attack while trying to figure out how to break out of the situation.</p>
<p>“His Highness is not involved. This is my own action”</p>
<p>“You’re not the one to decide that, you know? The people around you will get tied into it, even if you don’t want it to happen…Besides, you all decided not to listen to Anjelica back then, right? Why do think that the same thing won’t happen to you guys?”</p>
<p>Jilk found himself flustered and at a loss for words.</p>
<p>It was as he said, they didn’t pay any attention to Anjelica’s arguments back then. They didn’t know about the matter of Marie being bullied, and yet they disregarded Anjelica when she said that she didn’t order for it to happen.</p>
<p>“T, that’s!”</p>
<p>“Enough──lie down.”</p>
<p>Leon’s voice turned cold for an instant, and he trampled on Jilk in the air, causing him to drop down onto the floor.</p>
<p>Like that, his consciousness started fading as he hit the floor.</p>
<p>“He even bothered my sister. Now then, I wonder what to do…”</p>
<p>Leon had already lost interest in Jilk. In any case, after being thrust into the ground, Jilk’s armor was tattered and likely couldn’t move.</p>
<p>The last thing he thought was,</p>
<p>(Your Highness, this is dangerous. You cannot…fight…him.)</p>
<p>That’s when his consciousness blacked out.</p>

<p>Thanks for the chapter.</p>
<p>Yeah… hypocrisy is fun. Especially when it’s not you being the hypocrite, you’re using against them 😉</p>

<p>It’s kind of sad that it took you this long to come to that realization.<br/>
There has been zero reason for him to take anything seriously since acquiring Luxon.<br/>
The threat of invasion by petty nobles is meaningless when he could easily waltz into the king’s palace and declare himself dictator.</p>

<p>Its due to his family, he had to come back when he acquired luxon since if he did not, Zola would have sent Colin, his younger brother to some old lady to be spoused, and now, since he became highly recognized due to his achievements as adventurer at a young age and got such huge militar and monetary power thanks to luxon being able to build anything, others need a means to tie him down and avoid putting him in arms reach of other countries, hence his status as baron and knight, and due to that position, he cant neither drop out and live with olivia in his island since it would give him harsh repercusions with other households and trouble his father and mother(not zola, he does not care about her nor her sons and daughters), tho he has said he can always escape and live on the giant airship with no problem tho, so it could be easy to take his family, olivia if she wants and fly around the world, and i doubt he cant move the island either since its full of machinery that luxon controls, but again, leon only acts when the crash is at least 10km ahead instead of when its 100km if you get what i mean</p>

<p>No you don’t seem to get it.<br/>
Luxon is a proper Artificial Intelligence. Luxon can create machinery. Machinery can make bigger machinery. Luxon can spawn raw materials from nothing. Mix it all together and what do you get?<br/>
skynet<br/>
Nothing has been shown that can compete with this and it makes any threat of “repercussions” utterly meaningless in the face of limitless and undying robot fleets. What is a sword and magic fantasy country of MAYBE half a million strong (and probably tens of thousands) going to do against an infinite robot army?</p>
<p>Let’s put it this way: for Luxon to lose, the glorious heroes who defeat him would need their own novel.</p>

<p>Thanks for the chapter!  I don’t know if this would end his life as a noble… if you were the king and you had such a formidable youngster, would you let him go or tie him tighter to the crown?  Especially if it becomes clear your heir was insulting his fiancée who was the daughter of an important house for a nobody?  Marie might  have light magic, but she’s manipulating the elites of the kingdom much too easily.  I wouldn’t be surprised if Leon ends up engaged to Angelica, and gets stuck having to instruct the prince and his buddies in real life adventuring or something…  demoting Leon would make his life much too easy… Or the king punishes Leon by making him a knight or something like that where he has to defend the kingdom.  Who knows?  I eagerly await the fallout from this arc.</p>

<p>Think he meant Leon would be ruined because nobody will want anything to do with him to avoid the future king’s, meaning Julian’s, wrath. Remember Leon’s sister commenting how even the 2nd and 3rd years were paying attention to what goes on around Julian because anyone he favors has got it made while those he detests are doomed.  Which would especially include Leon’s wife if she was like Zola and wanted to live in a house in the capital.</p>

<p>True, but Marie is a reincarnator. She took the roles of the Protagonist, and she planning to get the main “Item” that makes the Protagonist being called a Saint. I bet if she got the “Item”, the Royal Family will see her as a Hero, which is in a higher standings than even an important noble. Making her able to become the prince’s wife. That is, IF she gets it…</p>

<p>But Leon does not love Marie… their bets was that if Leon wins, the Prince will not get near Marie ever again. That means, the 4 guys have 1 less rival for Marie’s affections. That is what I meant.</p>

<p>Japanese is a heavily context-reliant language. The passage is ambiguous in the raw, so technically it could be either way, but considering the context, I think you’re right. It should be “you have one less rival”.</p>

<p>Thanks for the translation!  Looking forward to seeing Marie’s reaction to all this.  Just remember to eat and sleep and get some fresh air occasionally.  Can sympathize with all the time and effort put in to doing it well.  Heck just typing all the words out take quite a bit of time.</p>

<p>PS, wonder if Leon will tear Jilk’s armor apart like he did Greg’s?  After all part ended with Jilk passing out, not match ending or declared over.  Reminds me of tournament arc in Yurishia Yurishia Hakusho where one opponent kept picking Kuwabara up so could keep beating him without match ending.</p>

<p>Thanks for the chapter!!! lol. Arroganz is really the right word for Leon’s Amor and fighting style. He stomped down onto the Crown Prince’s foster brother in public, and he did so with enough force to possibly seriously injure him. Leon really does like pushing each and every one of them into a pit, both emotionally and physically. He is a superb sadist in his own right!! lol!!!</p>

<p>I’m curious how this would develop. If he beats Prince, then he has essentially made enemies of the future heir of the kingdom and his powerful retainers. Can he actually survive that?</p>

<p>Depends on how much of an emotional idiot the prince is.  If he continues to be a love struck fool running on emotion and ignores oath swore not to hold a grudge after duel then Leon will have a hard time even talking to girls much less finding a marriage partner.  Chance of finding allies or trading partners not afraid of prince’s ire will be troublesome as well.<br/>
On the other hand if the prince acknowledges Leon knew what he was talking about at the party along with the fact that he and the others are too arrogant and weak to protect Marie and learns from his mistakes he might man up enough to thank Leon for the lesson in humility, train to become stronger, and want a rematch in the future.</p>

<p>To be fair though,  it isn’t the highest hurdle in the world. Pretty sure the prince would be easy enough ploy to a simple honey trap.</p>

<p>Not worth the trouble and only gain would be a few minutes of satisfaction.  Even if death is a possibility in a duel and anything that happens in academy should stay in academy Leon would get in big trouble for killing the prince.  Probably executed if it looked deliberate instead of accidental.  Besides, he doesn’t want the prince and others dead, he wants them humiliated and realizing their own weaknesses.  Especially considering a war is going to break out at some point so it’d be better if the prince and others toughened up to be able to successfully defend the country so Leon doesn’t have to.</p>
<p>Speaking of opportunities, anyone think that he might be the ugly country noble Anjelica would have to marry if he hadn’t accepted the role of representative and she had lost after breaking the rules by bringing in an outsider to fight for her?  Or that her family might push for a marriage between them anyway since Julian broke their engagement, to punish Anjelica, and reward Leon for defending their family’s honor?</p>

“He even bothered my sister. Now then, I wonder what to do…” Leon is definitely thinking in which way he will verbally abuse the prince there.</p>
