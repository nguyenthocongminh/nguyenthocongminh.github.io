<h1>Afterword</h1>
<p>.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for buying the third volume of 『Otomege Sekai wa Mob ni Kibishii Sekai Desu』!</p>
<p>This is the author Mishima Yomu.</p>
<p>It’s also thanks to all of you reader that the third volume can be safely released.</p>
<p>My thanks.</p> <p>And then about the third volume──it’s thick (sweat)</p>
<p>I was thinking it since the time I was writing it, will the page number alright like this? ──Who cares, just write!</p>
<p>And, from there it ended up like this.</p>
<p>When I lined up volume one until three, isn’t the thickness like four volume of books?</p>
<p>Considering that, it’s a bargain to buy Mobseka isn’t it. (TN: Mobseka is how this series is called in Japan)</p>
<p>Now then, about the third volume, it became a story where various truths of 「that」 otome game world are coming into view.</p>
<p>The distorted marriage situation, and the reason why elves and other demi-human races were born.</p>
<p>And then, the truth of that otome game that came into light after the war against the principality.</p>
<p>There was also a shocking reunion for Leon, but the person himself must felt complicated.</p>
<p>Surely he is holding his head at his wits’ end while feeling apologetic toward his parents in the previous life.</p>
<p>The third volume──it’s the third section in the web version but, it became a story that even I felt emotional attachment to.</p>
<p>Because in here there is a character whose evaluation got drastically changed.</p>
<p>What kind of reaction it would be in the light novel version. I’m feeling scared but also looking forward to it.</p>
<p>The third volume is the improvement of the third section in the web version, I modified the part where Leon got dragged into power struggle.</p>
<p>Because of that, there might be a part that is not connected if you continue reading from the web novel version.</p>
<p>I’ll be glad if you readers can enjoy the light novel version in its own way.</p>
<p>Speaking of the difference with the web novel version, I was worrying until the end of how to treat Hertrude.</p>
<p>Inside this story she became a very pitiful character.</p>
<p>I didn’t really make any plan for her character at first.</p>
<p>In the end, I kept that part the same with the web novel.</p>
<p>But, I regretted it a bit when receiving her rough character design.</p>
<p>If it’s like this then I should make a different route from the web novel──was what I felt.</p>
<p>You can’t let your emotional attachment get stronger when a character received illustration huh.</p>
<p>I’m thinking that perhaps one day it will be nice if I can write a different route for Hertrude while thinking to end this afterword.</p>
<p>Well then, please keep rooting for me from here on too.</p>
