<h1>Chapter 12 – Ordinary Day</h1>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p>The next day after crashing into the marriage ceremony.</p>
<p>I had returned to the mansion and facing Noelle right now.</p>
<p>Noelle slapped me.</p>
<p>I could dodge it but──I chose to receive it.</p>
<p>「Are you satisfied?」</p>
<p>「You’re really the worst. Even though you don’t think anything of me, you came to save me──don’t make have any strange expectation like this!」</p>
<p>The reason for Noelle’s anger was complicated.</p>
<p>It seemed she was thankful that I came to save her but, she was angry at why a man with fiancées was doing something like this.</p>
<p>It was only natural for her to have such thoughts.</p>
<p>To be honest──I found it hard to understand why she chose me.</p>
<p>Just what was going on with my popular period?</p>
<p>Was it because such period never came in my previous life that it was now descending on me with interests?</p>
<p>Noelle shed tears and she wiped it with her hand.</p>
<p>「Don’t make me expecting anything like this. Even though I want to forget──I won’t be able to forget if you do something like this.」</p>
<p>I would return to the kingdom in less than a year.</p>
<p>Noelle’s treatment was still not decided but, we couldn’t be together even if I brought her back with me.</p>
<p>「I’m sorry. Even so──I wanted to save you.」</p>
<p>Noelle shook her head at my apology.</p>
<p>「Actually I also want to thank you. I want thank you a lot! But──spare me from this. It’s painful to fall in love with someone who has fiancée.」</p>
<p>I almost reached out at the crying Noelle.</p>
<p>I thought whether I should hug her but I gave up.</p>
<p>I couldn’t do anything even if I gave her kind words here.</p>
<p>I had finished with my apology so I went outside leaving Noelle in the room.</p>
<p>Luxion and Creare were waiting outside the room.</p>
<p>『Oh, master isn’t going to hug and console her?』</p>
<p>『Master is really  a sinful man. I totally respect you.』</p>
<p>Annoying AIs.</p>
<p>「Say whatever you like. Rather than that, when are you going to return Creare?」</p>
<p>『I’ll return soon. After all I’m also worried about overt here. I’ll also have to check on how the bad children are doing.』</p>
<p>「Bad children?」</p>
<p>『Secret!』</p>
<p>What was she hiding?</p>
<p>I wanted to ask her but if Creare was going back then I wanted her to deliver letters souvenirs.</p>
<p>I also needed to prepare various things so I started walking. Luxion and Creare were also floating up and down alongside me.</p>
<p>Luxion talked to me about the case this time.</p>
<p>『About Loic, he really tried to erase master. He tried to do that only behind the scenes with nothing but underhanded tricks but, there is no doubt that he was a troublesome opponent.』</p>
<p>「That guy is really scary huh. His specs were pointlessly high. I wonder why the capture targets are all pointlessly capable.」</p>
<p>When I turned my gaze at the courtyard that was visible from this corridor, I saw Julius and others doing barbeque there.</p>
<p>Julius was standing alone in front of the grill and handed out meat skewers to everyone.</p>
<p>「Yeah, this is done. Jilk, take this.」</p>
<p>「No your highness. Your highness has been doing nothing but cooking since the beginning, so I’ll take your place now.」</p>
<p>「I’m doing this because I like it. Don’t mind it, just have fun.」</p>
<p>Those guys had helped a lot with infiltrating the venue, so I gave them a special bonus which they used for this barbeque.</p>
<p>It looked like they were having fun at the garden.</p>
<p>Marie was gulping down a mug of nicely chilled beer in one go.</p>
<p>「Kaaaah! It’s seeping right inside me~」</p>
<p>What a hearty drinking style.</p>
<p>Even though her appearance was that of a teenage girl, she was drinking and eating like a middle-aged man.</p>
<p>Cara brought some skewered meats for Marie.</p>
<p>「Marie-sama, what a splendid drinking! Here, please eat this too! There are also a lot of meats! The vegetables too!」</p>
<p>「Muhohoho! This is the best! Cara, you eat a lot too. We’ll stuff ourselves full while we can. We don’t know when we’ll be able to do this again after all.</p>
<p>「Yes Marie-sama!」</p>
<p>I wondered why it made me wanted to cry when I watched Marie and others.</p>
<p>My eyes were blurry that I couldn’t see well.</p>
<p>Usually Kyle would be with Marie and Cara, but right now he had Yumeria-san hovering around him.</p>
<p>「Kyle! Look, I got us some meat skewers. Aa~n」</p>
<p>「I-I can eat by myself! Also Kaa-san, you’re eating nothing but meat! You need to eat your vegetables too!」</p>
<p>He must not wanted other people to see them mother and son getting along closely, but Yumeria-san was dejected by the refusal.</p>
<p>Kyle wanted to console her mother who was like that, but he was unable to be honest with himself.</p>
<p>「Ah youth」</p>
<p>『Master too you know?』</p>
<p>I ignored Luxion’s retort and looked at Cordelia-san who was looking troubled at the courtyard.</p>
<p>The reason she was troubled when looking around her was seeing how the noble youths who were highly acclaimed by everyone in the kingdom had ended up.</p>
<p>Jilk was placing his used skewers on a strange plate that had cracks on it.</p>
<p>Brad who was feeding pigeon and rabbit saw that and asked him.</p>
<p>「Jilk, that plate is just garbage isn’t it?」</p>
<p>「How rude. Can’t you understand how wonderful this plate is?」</p>
<p>「Now see here, I don’t want to say it but, did you really succeed as an antique dealer? I can’t help but feel suspicious.」</p>
<p>「──Brad-kun yourself, your claim that you were successful as a performer feels like a lie though? In the first place, your magic trick is unskillful.」</p>
<p>「It’s fine even if it’s unskillful. After all I received money for displaying my perfect existence with the magic as an extra.」</p>
<p>These guys, I was worried when I heard they were driven out from the mansion, but it looked like they were living strong out there.</p>
<p>The vitality that I felt from them was already at the level of cockroach.</p>
<p>But, all of them──their unique characteristic had grown even thicker now compared to before they were driven out.</p>
<p>Greg and Chris were also amazing.</p>
<p>Chris warned Greg when he saw his appearance.</p>
<p>「Greg, how about you wear some clothes?」</p>
<p>「Ah? I’m wearing some already.」</p>
<p>「What are you saying when you are just wearing a single speedo?」</p>
<p>「You are stupid huh, Chris. Look carefully! How’s it, my pectoral muscle!」</p>
<p>Greg’s skin when he made a pose glistened under the sun.</p>
<p>And then Chris who was warning Greg for his speedo appearance was also dressed in only a single loincloth.</p>
<p>「That’s just an underwear! Also muscles aren’t clothes!」</p>
<p>「You yourself are just wearing a single cloth!」</p>
<p>「Are you idiot? I’m also wearing a chest wrap.」</p>
<p><em>That ain’t it you guys</em>, I wanted to retort like that.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be helped that Cordelia-san was looking troubled.</p>
<p>Cordelia-san who was in such state was talking with Julius.</p>
<p>When I looked at Julius who was working up sweat with a refreshing smile in front of the grill──it felt mysterious because he looked normal due to the other four being so terrible.</p>
<p>Originally Julius was the crown prince of Hohlfahrt Kingdom.</p>
<p>His position wouldn’t allow him to do something like grilling meat.</p>
<p>「S-say, your highness.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「Why are you grilling meats since the start? Should I relief you?」</p>
<p>Julius took off the grill’s net and shook off the scorched things that had gotten attached on it.</p>
<p>「Everyone asked me that, but I feel the calmest when doing this. Besides, my experience is overwhelmingly lacking to become a fully fledged meat skewer cook. I want to accumulate experience from this kind of moment.」</p>
<p>What an admirable attitude──not that.</p>
<p>Just now, what did he say?</p>
<p>Cordelia-san turned a cold look toward Julius.</p>
<p>「Your highness is still a prince of Hohlfahrt Kingdom, you won’t be able to become something like a cook I believe?」</p>
<p>She made a calm retort.</p>
<p>Julius made the tongs opened and closed with clacking sounds while answering Cordelia-san.</p>
<p>「Don’t you think it’ll be good if there is at least one prince who mastered the way of grilling meat?」</p>
<p>「I don’t think so.」</p>
<p>Cordelia-san answered instantly. Seeing her, I got the feeling that I would be able to get along well with this person.</p>
<p>As fellow person of common sense that is.</p>
<p>When I looked down at Marie and others from the window like this, it made felt a little bit absurd.</p>
<p>「Looks like those guys are having fun.」</p>
<p>Creare suggested to me to invite Noelle.</p>
<p>『Then how about master invite Noelle-chan and join them?』</p>
<p>「Stu~pid. It’ll only make the atmosphere feel awkward even though they’re having fun right now. More importantly, I need to prepare before you return. Come on, let’s get going.」</p>
<p>I brought Luxion and Creare toward the harbor.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p>The barbeque ended at the evening.</p>
<p>A guest came at that timing. It was Marie who entertained the guest.</p>
<p>The guest was──Louise.</p>
<p>After she welcomed her in, Louise said that she had a business with Noelle so Marie brought her there.</p>
<p>But the atmosphere was awkward.</p>
<p>Marie wasn’t close with Louise, and Noelle had bad relationship with Louise.</p>
<p>Besides, Noelle was depressed right now and wasn’t lively at all.</p>
<p>(Could it be that big bro, is the type to run away when he think that it will become a bloodbath? He is always gone when there is an important scene, is it because he detected the danger? I guess not. That big bro has no such ability.)</p>
<p>Louise sighed while Marie was escaping from reality like that and approached Noelle.</p>
<p>And then she slapped her.</p>
<p>*Slap-!* Such sound echoed inside the room, then Noelle got angry after a delay.</p>
<p>「W-what are you doing!」</p>
<p>Louise looked at Noelle and made a ridiculing smile.</p>
<p>「I got the desire to slap you because you are making this face of, <em>I’m so unfortunate boo hoo</em>. You’re really an extravagant woman huh. I wonder if you know just how much Leon-kun was running around for your sake?」</p>
<p>「T-that’s──it’s because Leon is kind.」</p>
<p>「No one would go as far as picking a fight with Alzer just from mere kindness. Your head really is filled with flowers.」</p>
<p>Marie knew about the actual situation.</p>
<p>The reason Leon saved Noelle was for avoiding the danger to the world.</p>
<p>But, as for what Leon himself was actually thinking, she could only imagine it.</p>
<p>(This is big bro we are talking about, so surely he saved her thinking she is pitiful. Even then he can’t answer the girl’s feeling──he is really the worst since the past.)</p>
<p>In their previous life similar things also happened several times although in smaller scale.</p>
<p>Her big brother’s romantic life was irritating so she didn’t get involved but──well, he had been a dense big brother even when she thought back like this.</p>
<p>Louise approached Noelle until the distance when their nose touched each other.</p>
<p>「I hate you. I hate you for living carefreely without knowing anything. Even now you still haven’t noticed just how happy you have it.」</p>
<p>「D-do you know just how much hardships we had gone through!? Everything was because of your house’s fault!」</p>
<p>「Oh, is that so? You two could enroll into the academy easygoingly even though your house was destroyed, who do you think you need to thank for that? Are you seriously thinking that the background of you sisters could be completely hidden with just the effort of your retainers?」</p>
<p>Noelle averted her gaze from Louise.</p>
<p>「I──don’t know anything about that. We were just told to enroll into the academy.」</p>
<p>Louise folded her arms.</p>
<p>「It was really a bothersome situation. ──But, the person who is the most bothered is Leon-kun who saved you. Noelle, what are you going to do after this?」</p>
<p>Noelle looked down and shook her head.</p>
<p>「I still haven’t decided. I haven’t decided yet.」</p>
<p>「──Go back to the academy for a while. It looks like Otou-sama will also permit it. it seems that it’ll also be fine even if you follow Leon-kun when he go back to his country. It’s also fine even if you stay behind though.」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>When Noelle lifted her face, Louise shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>「Do as you like, that’s what I‘m saying. Decide your future course before Leon-kun and others return home. I come here today to tell you that.」</p>
<p>When Louise left the room, Noelle was rooted on the spot.</p>
<p>But, it was Marie who was the most troubled.</p>
<p>(Why is the last boss and the villainess are helping the main character!? Aaaaaa!! I don’t get it at allllll!!)</p>
<p>Even though she wouldn’t need to worry about anything if things were simpler──Marie held her head in her hands because she couldn’t predict the future development.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p>Creare had returned──calm came back to the commonwealth around the middle of the second semester.</p>
<p>It was really chaotic in the commonwealth at the first semester and the summer vacation.</p>
<p>Because of that, the academy’s events──the romance events if you said it in otome game terminology, they were all crushed.</p>
<p>That happened also because the six great nobles caused scandals in succession.</p>
<p>At the academy rooftop.</p>
<p>I gave half of the lunch bread that I purchased to Marie while talking with Lelia.</p>
<p>We were talking about what to do now.</p>
<p>But it didn’t become a useful dialogue.</p>
<p>Lelia was complaining too today.</p>
<p>「What now! Really what now!? All the events are crushed even though a long vacation is going to arrive soon, this is completely unexpected!」</p>
<p>I agreed with what Lelia said.</p>
<p>I heard that when a girl was angry, it was pointless even if you replied logically.</p>
<p>It seemed it would be better if you agreed with her 「It’s troublesome isn’t it~」 in sympathy.</p>
<p>「That’s right isn’t it. It’s troublesome isn’t it~. Oi Marie! Don’t eat them all!」</p>
<p>The brown paper bag that was filled with several small croissants was almost emptied.</p>
<p>Marie apologized.</p>
<p>「Hah!? S-sorry. I had my head full with eating.」</p>
<p>Lelia yelled angrily because the topic was diverted.</p>
<p>「It’s the fault of you guys! Pierre is gone, Loic is also gone, Hughes too has his engagement cancelled, but he doesn’t have any flag with big sis! Narcisse-sensei was rounded up to help his family and is gone from the academy, what are we going to do now!」</p>
<p>About Loic, he didn’t come to the academy using injury as excuse.</p>
<p>As for Hughes, he ran away leaving Louise-san alone when the incident happened. Because of that their engagement was cancelled.</p>
<p>That was the reason at the surface, but the true reason was because Fernand betrayed Albergue-san.</p>
<p>And then the six great nobles that were in mayhem called Narcisse-sensei back and they moved around in confusion.</p>
<p>They were busy with things like dealing with other countries, or apologizing to the kingdom.</p>
<p>Lelia stood in front of us with her hands on her waist to emphasize that she was angry.</p>
<p>This girl, so she could act cute huh.</p>
<p>「Are you two listening to what I’m saying!?」</p>
<p>「I’m listening. In other words, you have no idea of how to deal with the last boss right?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. Really what are we going to do now.」</p>
<p>While Lelia was holding her head in her hands, Luxion who had been keeping quiet until now while observing the situation showed himself.</p>
<p>Lelia went 「Hyah!」 in surprise, but Luxion ignored her.</p>
<p>『Ultimately there is no need to worry about the last boss. In the first place, what master and Marie are worrying about is the commonwealth’s situation after the last boss is defeated.』</p>
<p>「Eh? After it’s defeated?」</p>
<p>『I’m currently hastening my analysis of the sacred tree, but I have judged that it’s possible to deal with it using the attack of my main body. What’s important is how well we will be able to calm down the commonwealth after that happened.』</p>
<p>Lelia opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p>「Y-you can do something like that?」</p>
<p>『Yes. It’s also possible for me to sink this land right away.』</p>
<p>Lelia grabbed my collar when she heard that dangerous talk.</p>
<p>「Hey, what is he saying!? What is he saying!? These guy’s words are really scary! I got the feeling that he is saying something like sinking Alzer if things become hopeless though!」</p>
<p>It was incorrigible because it was the fact.</p>
<p>I didn’t know how I should answer her──so I glossed it over by laughing.</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha!」</p>
<p>「Don’t gloss it over! Gloss it over, wait, that means he really can do that!? Hey, can he really do that!? Or rather, this guy is going to do something like that!?」</p>
<p>Luxion answered sincerely.</p>
<p>『That’s only if the situation is really hopeless. I don’t mind doing that right away, but master won’t give me permission.』</p>
<p>I soothed down Lelia.</p>
<p>「That’s how it is. If possible I want things to end up in the ideal state, I’ll also help out to take care of the aftermath──anyway don’t worry about the last boss. We will deal with it if things really become hopeless,.」</p>
<p>Marie nodded with a croissant in her mouth.</p>
<p>「Yeah. That’s why don’t worry.」</p>
<p>That was unsightly, I wished you would finish eating before speaking.</p>
<p>Leli let go of me and casted her gaze down.</p>
<p>「T-that means, this country will sink depending on your mood.」</p>
<p>「What a rude fellow. No way we are going to do something like that.」</p>
<p>Lelia wasn’t really listening after that when we resumed talking.</p>
<p>Did I threaten her too much?</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p>On the way home from the academy.</p>
<p>Lelia was walking totteringly.</p>
<p>She refused Emile’s invitation to send her until home and walked back alone like this because she wanted to think alone.</p>
<p>(This is bad. That Luxion is even more dangerous than expected. That’s right, that guy is a paid item that came out in the first game. It’s not normal.)</p>
<p>The game balance of that otome game’s first title was strange.</p>
<p>It was so unbalanced the players needed to buy paid item to clear it.</p>
<p>Among the paid items, the weapon called Luxion possessed an overwhelming ability.</p>
<p>(I don’t know how to deal with something like that when it appears in reality. Depending on those guys’ mood, even I might become collateral damage if I’m unlucky.)</p>
<p>When she thought about what Alzer had done to Leon until now, it wouldn’t be strange for him to accumulate dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>She didn’t know when that dissatisfaction would blow up.</p>
<p>In addition, it was the six great nobles that were meddling with Leon.</p>
<p>She had no way to stop them.</p>
<p>(This is like being told that there is an even more powerful enemy than the last boss.)</p>
<p>It felt like someone else was having life-and-death power over her.</p>
<p>She couldn’t stay calm at all.</p>
<p>Besides, she also couldn’t trust Leon.</p>
<p>After all he was that kind of human who did extreme things in order to take back Noelle.</p>
<p>Lelia was unbearably anxious.</p>
<p>(If it’s like this then I need power that can oppose him──but, is there any weapon in Alzer than can oppose Luxion? It’ll be possible if it’s the same paid item but──I won’t be able to collect something like that by myself.)</p>
<p>Unlike the academy of Hohlfahrt Kingdom, the academy of Alzer Commonwealth didn’t teach the students the fundamental of being adventurer.</p>
<p>Lelia herself had very little knowledge about that. It was impossible for her to recover the item with her own strength.</p>
<p>(That’s right. I know the location. After that, if I can just obtain it──)</p>
<p>The paid item of the second game that she hadn’t collected until now.</p>
<p>While she was thinking of the method to collect the item, someone stood in front of Lelia.</p>
<p>That man had his shirt unbuttoned on the chest area in this cold.</p>
<p>His black hair was swept back. He had healthy looking tanned skin.</p>
<p>He was also tall. The muscles that were visible from the unbuttoned shirt were firm.</p>
<p>The man──Serge Sara Rault raised his hand and talked to Lelia amiably.</p>
<p>「Yo, long time no see Lelia!」</p>
<p>「──Serge.」</p>
<p>He was none other than the fifth capture target.</p>
<p>Although Lelia was surprised, she asked him where he had been going until now.</p>

<p>「Y-you, where had you been until now!」</p>
<p>「Are you worried? I’m happy. Oops, if you want to hear about my adventuring tale, do you want to eat together with me? It’ll take a bit long after all. The adventure this time was just a bit tough you know. Really, how about we eat together? This is our reunion after so long after all, it’s okay right?」</p>
<p>He had a really lighthearted attitude, but he was the heir of Rault House.</p>
<p>He was Albergue’s adopted son.</p>
<p>This youth had quite a lot of rough spot in him, but he dreamed to be an adventurer──and also, he was a reliable boy as an adventurer.</p>
<p>Lelia gasped.</p>
<p>(That’s right. If I ask for Serge’s help)</p>
<p>Lelia accepted Serge’s invitation.</p>
<p>「Fine. Let’s go eat together.」</p>
<p>Serge was surprised.</p>
<p>「That’s rare of you. I thought that you would refuse but──is it really alright?」</p>
<p>「What? We aren’t going?」</p>
<p>「Stupid! Of course we are going! More importantly, what do you want to eat? It’s a rare chance for us to eat together after all. Ask for anything!」</p>
<p>Lelia was relieved seeing Serge’s delighted look.</p>
<p>(Thank god that Serge is interested with me.)</p>
<p>Lelia had dinner together with Serge that day.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p>Emile was waiting when Lelia returned home.</p>
<p>It seemed that he had prepared dinner.</p>
<p>「Lelia, about the dinner──」</p>
<p>「Sorry, I have eaten.」</p>
<p>「I-I see.」</p>
<p>「Sorry Emile.」</p>
<p>Pleven House had prepared a mansion near the academy for Lelia’s sake.</p>
<p>It was nearer to the academy than her previous apartment. She was living together with Emile there.</p>
<p>There were also several servants there, but the mansion itself wasn’t especially big.</p>
<p>Emile was thoughtful.</p>
<p>He could cook and clean, and above all else he was kind.</p>
<p>Lelia had no dissatisfaction with him.</p>
<p>But, she felt that something was lacking.</p>
<p>(Even though he can eat first without waiting for me. This made the atmosphere heavy.)</p>
<p>「Emile, about the next long vacation, I’m going to have a bit of business to take care. That’s why, I won’t be able to go back home with you.」</p>
<p>「Eh? Is that so? But, we have already promised.」</p>
<p>「Please. Don’t ask me anything.」</p>
<p>(That guy is too dangerous. I have to obtain at least the same power no matter what.)</p>
<p>She would go out adventuring with Serge in order to prepare countermeasure against Leon.</p>
<p>She couldn’t tell Emile about it.</p>
<p>And then it would also trouble her if she was asked to explain in detail.</p>
<p>Emile looked disappointed.</p>
<p>「I, I see. But, let’s at least give a quick greeting to my family. My big brothers are also waiting, we also need to talk about the future.」</p>
<p>「──okay.」</p>
<p>Lelia said that and the shut herself in her room.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p>Around the time the academy entered the long vacation.</p>
<p>A single airship entered Alzer’s harbor.</p>
<p>It was Licorne with its characteristic white hull.</p>
<p>Livia walked down the ramp and waved her hand to Ange while her hand was carrying a large traveling bag.</p>
<p>「Ange, let’s go quickly!」</p>
<p>Ange who was also carrying a bag as big as Livia’s smiled seeing Livia like that.</p>
<p>「Leon won’t run away even if we don’t hurry.」</p>
<p>The two of them immediately departed to the commonwealth when the long vacation arrived.</p>
<p>They had taken care almost of all their businesses beforehand for this.</p>
<p>Livia had been looking forward to this day that she couldn’t sleep last night.</p>
<p>「I want to surprise Leon-san quickly.」</p>
<p>「Got it. I also agree with that.」</p>
<p>It seemed Ange was also looking forward to this. She was smiling a lot since before they arrived at the commonwealth.</p>
<p>Previously──at the summer vacation, they were unable to sightsee a lot at the commonwealth.</p>
<p>This time they planned to sightsee leisurely.</p>
<p>Creare was watching the two.</p>
<p>『You two look like you’re having fun. Over there they look like they will be really busy with work though.』</p>
<p>Ange turned her eyes toward another airship that came together with them from the kingdom.</p>
<p>「They will have a lot of work waiting for them after this.」</p>
<p>This time a lot of airships were visiting from the kingdom.</p>
<p>They also acted as Ange’s guard, but the other ships were also boarded with the diplomats that were dispatched for the dialogue with the commonwealth.</p>
<p>Scandals with Pierre and Loic had happened in succession.</p>
<p>The kingdom too couldn’t keep quiet with the case this time. They already had several talks before this.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of personnel were dispatched from the kingdom in order for the final adjustment of the agreement.</p>
<p>Livia said.</p>
<p>「Leon-san will be surprised this time.」</p>
<p>Ange also agreed.</p>
<p>「Yeah. Well, I too wanted to ask him a lot of things about what happened in Alzer even if I have to skip out my work. The information that came to the kingdom is few. Creare also won’t talk.」</p>
<p>『Oh, are you criticizing me? There is a proper reason for this though~』</p>
<p>「Good grief.」</p>
<p>Ange was talking with a smiling face. But she frowned when she saw airships entering the harbor.</p>
<p>Livia tilted her head.</p>
<p>「What’s the matter?」</p>
<p>「──Those are Rachelle’s airship. There are a lot of them.」</p>
<p>The airships of Holy Kingdom Rachelle entered Alzer’s harbor in great number.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 7</h2>
<p>The second semester was over and we entered a long vacation.</p>
<p>I──together with Noelle exited Marie’s mansion.</p>
<p>The reason? It was Cordelia-san.</p>
<p>Cordelia-san’s words「Angelica-sama will worry if you keep living in Marie’s mansion forever」 were reasonable after all.</p>
<p>When I returned to the house in Alzer that I used at the beginning, the inside of the room was covered in dust.</p>
<p>「Uwa~, this is awful.」</p>
<p>Cordelia-san rolled up her sleeves.</p>
<p>「We have to prioritize cleaning the bedrooms and the kitchen. Then, first let’s open the window so fresh air can come in. We have to air the mattress.」</p>
<p>Yumeria-san also followed behind Cordelia-san.</p>
<p>Even though I told her it was alright if she stayed behind in Marie’s mansion, she firmly refused because she was my maid and also watcher.</p>
<p>Watcher──it was good that she had the awareness of it, but it was no good if she said that to the person she ought to watch.</p>
<p>Good grief──this person is hopelessly cute.</p>
<p>The two of them headed to the second floor. Then Luxion saw the baby bed that had been left behind her.</p>
<p>I approached it.</p>
<p>「come to think of it, we brought this thing here.」</p>
<p>Noelle-chan──the pet dog that Jean kept was using this when we were taking care of it here. But now Noelle-chan was already gone so it was brought here because it wasn’t used anymore.</p>
<p>Noelle was also looking nostalgic.</p>
<p>「This is the one that we were using before the summer vacation isn’t it? I see, so it’s placed here.」</p>
<p>The collar was still attached around Noelle’s neck.</p>
<p>She decorated it herself when going to the academy to keep it out from view. Right now she had gone back to her bright personality just like before.</p>
<p>But she seemed lonely somewhere in her.</p>
<p>「You could still stay at Marie’s mansion though? Is it alright for you to stay together with me?」</p>
<p>Noelle scratched her head when I asked her that.</p>
<p>「That’s an unpleasant way of asking. Well, there is also this feeling of mine that want to stay there though. It’s fun there every day, and Marie-chan is also kind.」</p>
<p>「Ee~, that girl is kind?」</p>
<p>「She is kind. But──you know, she has romantic relations with those five. Even if I don’t intend it, I often caught them in the act.」</p>
<p>I tended to forget but, those five were Marie’s lovers.</p>
<p>When living together with them, sometimes I would come across that kind of scene.</p>
<p>Noelle too seemed to take that into consideration.</p>
<p>「That girl seemed reluctant that Noelle is moving out though.」</p>
<p>She looked really depressed when she heard that Noelle, Cordelia-san, and Yumeria-san who had been helping with the housework would be leaving.</p>
<p>The number of servants in her place had also increased, even then they were still short of hands there.</p>
<p>In the first place that mansion was too large.</p>
<p>But there also wasn’t any need to refuse if Noelle said that she wanted to come to my place.</p>
<p>「Well, it doesn’t matter.」</p>
<p>Noelle joined her hands behind her back after I said that.</p>
<p>She looked shy.</p>
<p>「Hey, Leon──do you know about local wife?」</p>
<p>Noelle laughed shyly when I was unable to reply.</p>
<p>「I thought that perhaps, becoming one might be fine but, I wonder what Leon might thing about it」</p>
<p>It was an attractive proposal for a man but, could Noelle become happy with that?</p>
<p>「You, are you alright with that? Are you really not going to regret it?」</p>
<p>Noelle’s expression turned depressed.</p>
<p>「Sorry. As I thought it might be impossible. It was embarrassing to say that, and it makes me a bit sad.」</p>
<p>「Right? Our current distance will be better for both of us.」</p>
<p>More than friend, less than lover──further development than this was impossible.</p>
<p>Luxion who had been listening to our talk seemed to have been waiting for this timing to speak to Noelle.</p>
<p>『Is it alright for me to give a report?』</p>
<p>「W-what? Say it if you are here!」</p>
<p>Luxion looked at my left arm while Noelle was being surprised.</p>
<p>『I have found a way to take off the collar.』</p>
<p>Finally? I asked Luxion why it took so long.</p>
<p>「It took a lot of time for you huh.」</p>
<p>『I was taking my time in order to do it safely. The method to take it off itself didn’t take long to discover, but I also investigated how to do it safely. Cutting it with the chain materialized will put the least burden to the body for taking it off.』</p>
<p>「Isn’t that method too plain?」</p>
<p>It seemed Noelle also thought so.</p>
<p>「Then we should have cut it right away.」</p>
<p>『If we try to cut it carelessly, the collar will tighten──and take off the head. Physically.』</p>
<p>「──Hey, will it really be fine? Is that method really the safest method?」</p>
<p>Noelle was getting scared.</p>
<p>『Among the chain rings, there is just one of them that won’t trigger the effect. The collar can be taken off after we destroy that. There is no problem because I have pinpointed its location.』</p>
<p>I looked at Noelle.</p>
<p>「Should we?」</p>
<p>「U~n, I’m scared, but──I’m thinking that perhaps it’ll also be fine to just leave it like this.」</p>
<p>「Eh!?」</p>
<p>「B-because, this too is one of my few bonds with Leon.」</p>
<p>It was sweet when she said that but, I also wanted to be spared from the suspicion of having an abnormal hobby.</p>
<p>When those who were in the know of the cursed collar saw Noelle, they would immediately look at the bracelet on me and made an「Uwah!」 face.</p>
<p>「No good. It’s causing difficulty in our daily life so let’s take it off.」</p>
<p>「──Leon you idiot.」</p>
<p>Luxion showed which part of the chain should be cut.</p>
<p>『It’s the part near the collar. Master, you should pull the chain, then I will cut it with a tool.』</p>
<p>「Got it.」</p>
<p>I materialized the chain and stretched it tautly, but the part that should be cut was near Noelle’s collar.</p>
<p>When I pulled it, it made felt strange for some reason.</p>
<p>There was also how Noelle closed her eyes nervously. It made my heart to pound hard strangely.</p>
<p>『Then, please wait while I prepare the tool. The tool is prepared at Einhorn, I will head there to retrieve it now.』</p>
<p>「You, say that beforehand!」</p>
<p>『Master is the one misunderstanding. Then, excuse me for now.』</p>
<p>Luxion went out from the window and heading to Einhorn. I and Noelle looked at each other and we snorted.</p>
<p>「Aa~, sorry. I misunderstood that this thing can be taken off right away.」</p>
<p>「It’s fine. I also misunderstood like that. Even so, the feeling of the collar got stronger with the chain materialized like this.」</p>
<p>Noelle held the chain and made clinking sound with it. Certainly it made the obscene feel of it stronger.</p>
<p>「Certainly. It made me feel strange.」</p>
<p>Noelle went along with my joke.</p>
<p>「Leon you pervert.」</p>
<p>「What? Should I say<em> isn’t it fine</em> here?」</p>
<p>I approached her while making lewd movement with my fingers. Noelle covered her chest with both hands and twisted away.</p>
<p>「What are you doing while the sun is still this high, stuuupid.」</p>
<p>Noelle was laughing happily.</p>
<p>A relationship where you can joke with each other is really important isn’t it.</p>
<p>Then the room’s door opened.</p>
<p>Cordelia-san was watching me with a cold gaze.</p>
<p>「──Leon-sama, what are you doing?」</p>
<p>「Eh? This is, it’s just the usual joke.」</p>
<p>I tried to gloss it over with a laugh, but then the door opened fully and showed other people behind Cordelia-san.</p>
<p>Far behind was Yumeria-san who was trembling while holding the sapling’s case──not that, the problem was the other two people there.</p>
<p>Over there was the smiling Livia──she was tilting her head with her hands joined together.</p>
<p>「Hee, so you two are always doing this kind of joke.」</p>
<p>「Li-Livia!」</p>
<p>There was also Ange with expressionless face.</p>

<p>「I’m also here. Even so, we didn’t visit this house previously but──to think, there is a secret that you are hiding here. I never even imagined it.」</p>
<p>「Se-secret!? What do you mean secret──hah!」</p>
<p>Ange and Livia were sending their gazes toward the baby bed.</p>
<p>In a further stroke of bad luck, they saw Noelle’s collar and my bracelet were linked by a chain.</p>
<p>Livia’s smiling face was scary.</p>
<p>「Leon-san, you will give us explanation right?」</p>
<p>「T-this person here is──hah!」</p>
<p>I noticed another danger just when I was going to introduce Noelle.</p>
<p>I recalled a single fact.</p>
<p>It was at our first semester.</p>
<p>I took care of the dog that Jean kept because he was injured──that dog’s name was “Noelle”.</p>
<p>And then the one here was also Noelle──I hadn’t told them that the dog Noelle-chan had died.</p>
<p>I didn’t tell them because I didn’t want to worry them.</p>
<p>But now it became extremely bad.</p>
<p>Noelle introduced herself with a troubled look.</p>
<p>「I, I’m──Noelle. Noelle Beltre. I’m going to the same academy with Leon. E-eh? Did I introduce myself before this?」</p>
<p>The collared Noelle introduced herself like that.</p>
<p>It was a long time ago, so Noelle introduced herself for the second time but──it seemed her doing that was problematic.</p>
<p>It was like pouring oil into fire.</p>
<p>「We met before at Marie’s mansion didn’t we? Wait, Noelle──you say? I see, so that’s how it is. How stupid of me, I didn’t notice it before.」</p>
<p>When Ange started to chuckle, Cordelia-san straightened her back.</p>
<p>She was focusing to be a background so that she wouldn’t stand out as a maid.</p>
<p>Stop! Don’t escape by yourself!</p>
<p>Livia’s misunderstanding was also accelerating.</p>
<p>「Noelle-chan──I heard that it was a seventeen years old female dog but, so that’s how it is. I was misunderstanding. ──So she is actually a human. I misunderstood her to be an old dog.」</p>
<p>「Y-you’re mistaken! Noelle-chan the dog really existed!」</p>
<p>「I didn’t know that Leon-san has that kind of hobby.」</p>
<p>Livia’s face turned serious.</p>
<p>I couldn’t stop sweating.</p>
<p>Ange’s gaze was fixed to the baby bed.</p>
<p>「In that case this place, is your love nest with that Noelle-chan huh? I never even dreamed that your letter for us was written with your life with your mistress. Leon, you’re really something.」</p>
<p>It sounded like a praise, but it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Her eyes toward me looked like they were blazing with flame of indignation.</p>
<p>If I made even a single mistake, it felt like Ange would be enraged and blazed up for real.</p>
<p>Shit! I was feeling the chills.</p>
<p>Even if I tried to make an excuse, the situation was too bad.</p>
<p>Livia questioned Noelle.</p>
<p>「Noelle-san, we have met before haven’t we? I have thought it’s suspicious since that time. You have known that Leon-san have us as fiancées haven’t you?」</p>
<p>Noelle who was questioned like that──apologized to Livia.</p>
<p>「I’m──sorry」</p>
<p>Wait! Don’t apologize! First we need to dispel the misunderstanding here!</p>
<p>That’s right. If Noelle said that this was a misunderstanding──if she said that, would the misunderstanding get cleared up?</p>
<p>When I looked at Cordelia-san, she averted her gaze from me.</p>
<p>Th-this woman, you are betraying me at this important time!? C-come to think of it, her gaze had been cold sometimes when looking at me!</p>
<p>I looked toward Yumeria-san to ask for help.</p>
<p>Yumeria-san was in panic with her mouth opening and closing with only ‘awawawa’ sound.</p>
<p>「T-that, Leon-sama kidnapped Noelle-san from a marriage ceremony! W-with that the two of them are close with each other, that!」</p>
<p>The panicking Yumeria-san was pouring even more oil into the fire.</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t oil she was pouring but a bomb.</p>
<p>I was happy that she was trying to explain about the circumstance of me saving Noelle and other things to dispel the misunderstanding. I was happy but, unfortunately it was accelerating Ange and Livia’s misunderstanding.</p>
<p>「He kidnapped a bride you said? Leon, you will tell me about it in more detail right? And about your hobby too, this is a good chance so let me hear all about it as your fiancée.」</p>
<p>「So Leon-san like Noelle-san that much. You have even prepared a baby bed.」</p>
<p>What’s the meaning of this?</p>
<p>Why didn’t the two of them know about what had been going on in Alzer?</p>
<p>Certainly my contact with them was only the minimum, but Creare should have returned to them.</p>
<p>Hadn’t they heard about the situation from her?</p>
<p>And then I noticed one more fact.</p>
<p>──Why didn’t Luxion tell me that the two of them were coming?</p>
<p>If it was him then he should have noticed.</p>
<p>And then, when I considered how he wasn’t here at this timing──.</p>
<p>「Y-you set me up huh. You set me up huh, Luxion!!」</p>
<p>Ange and Livia brought their face close to me.</p>
<p>「Leon, I’ll have you confess everything!」</p>
<p>「Leon-san, you will get an extra strict “Bad-!” this time!」</p>
<p>And then I noticed.</p>
<p>The scene that looked like me cheating from all angles.</p>
<p>The betrayal of the AIs.</p>
<p>And then, all the misunderstandings that had been accumulating until now to create this extremely bad situation.</p>
<p>This──could it be perhaps, a checkmate for me!?</p>

<p>She and Serge are 100% going to make the situation worst. I don’t even get why Leila continually does everything against Leon. There is no legit reason for her to do so but we gotta have a biatch character for this arc.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Well Leila opened some achievement here.<br/>
Achievement unlocked:<br/>
*Stupid THOT (gather every readers hatred by her own justifying action)<br/>
*Skillful merchant (Sold out her sister to Loic)<br/>
*Unparalled Trouble Makers (most of this chaos caused by her stupid decision)<br/>
*Double Faced Villain (pretend help MC and betray him later)<br/>
*Suck Judgement (Often make mistakes about reading people)<br/>
*Petite Evil (Being flat and do something bad which hated by most readers)<br/>
*Hypocryte EX (Being trusted by Noelle which she treated like a tool instead of sister)<br/>
*Seductive B!tch (ensnare good rich people like Emile to her charm)<br/>
*Useless EX (Even Marie and Leon didn’t need her help at all, she’s too useless as informan)</p>
<p>Is there anymore?</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks BP-sama, stay healthy</p>
<p>Guess we were right about Leila.<br/>
She’s b!tch to the core. Good, nobody like you now and I hope Emile will broke up with you soon. B!tch like her didn’t deserve any happiness.</p>
<p>Maybe the other think that she just paranoid or just bad at reading people but for me that doesn’t justifying all of her action that she did up until now. Guess her best efforts that she deluded by herself just suck after all. Cause i can point out all of her action wad contradicting with her own statement</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>She’s just stupid, not malicious.</p>
<p>Lelia has perfectly reasonable concerns about Leon, which he has not made a serious effort to allay.  Yes, it was stupid for her to try the Loic route when she had no clear knowledge about the (unusually easily reached) bad end and couldn’t spot the warning signs.  She should have pushed Noelle to the safe-tile…except that safe-tile-kun is boring and Noelle probably wouldn’t like him (interestingly, her core complaint about Loic isn’t anything to do with him being a psychopath, but all about how he basically tried too hard to please a generic woman without properly looking at her…it’s like she’s saying “Emile would be just as bad”, which is kinda nuts if you ask me).</p>
<p>Frankly, I still think that Lelia was doomed to fail at the outset because Noelle simply doesn’t like the Alzer nobility in general, the only one who seems like he might be enough of an exception to please her would be Narcisse, and I don’t believe he’s enough of an exception for the sapling to recognize him.  The sacred tree chose a commoner as the Guardian for a reason, it found the Alzer nobles as a class unsuitable.  They haven’t exactly been mending their ways since.</p>
<p>Leon Rault was an exception, and I’m pretty sure he’d have made an acceptable Guardian from the perspective of the sacred tree…but he was probably murdered for that very reason (and to strip the protections of the priestess and Guardian by making it impossible for them to fulfill an oath they made to the sacred tree).  Then Albergue and the other nobles began working on a way to corrupt the sacred tree.  It’s unknown who other than Albergue knows the method to merge with the sacred tree, but certainly Albergue must know how.</p>
<p>People are claiming that absolutely everything that goes wrong is Lelia’s fault because that was the premise of the WN.  But that just doesn’t make any sense.  The Lelia who is desperate to save her country from destruction but simply doesn’t have any good options for doing so (yes, partly because she’s pretty dumb) is the LN version.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Well you know I didn’t think that she even care with Alzer and her sister, in my POV she just b!tch who care about herself. You know, every hypocrite could state themselves like that.<br/>
Statement : I care toward Alzer.<br/>
Reality : She did nothing, even she had Emile and Clement she didn’t use them as their fullest potential be at last for information gathering nor for persuade some noble to join her will, in my POV I don’t see that she is make any efforts to it. So Luxion is truly nightmares huh? So the Alzer noble try to negotiate peace with kingdom huh? Good, now let’s provoke them more by persuade Serge to looking for weapon who could put a fight against Luxion.<br/>
Statement : I cared for my sister<br/>
Reality : Didn’t actually check the plot, She don’t care with her sister feel, didn’t trigger to open flag for another capture target and took Emile for herself, didn’t do anything when Pierre bullying her, Sold her sister to awful man like Loic,<br/>
Statement : Sacred Tree Sappling is important<br/>
Reality : Then why you didn’t started by fvcking looked for it huh? What did you do up until now? If you had a will to looking for a weapon which rumored strong as Luxion then why didn’t you had any will to look for sacred tree sappling?<br/>
And much more which you guys can figure out by yourself.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to offended anyone</p>
<p>Even I don’t know why am I got irritated toward her more than to Aizen (Bleach) and Naraku (Inuyasha) there?</p>

<p>I mean somewhat we prefer clever evil scumbag instead of stupid naive protagonist right because basically everyone had a reason for their downfall to crime path (laugh at psycopath, demon, satanist cult, etc)<br/>
Or maybe you just personally hate selfish hypocrite?<br/>
You know I don’t hate too much that kind of people unleast their selfish hypocrite action make everyone got fvcked up, for sure I curse that kind of people to death</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Hey, don’t blame Leon, in my POV as cultured dense man he’s innocent. If something to put blame is the Alzer nobles first who dare to disturb his peaceful life who pissed him off and then came some stupid bitch who can not read people and suck to intrepet their intention who made the current problem become more disaster in future. Don’t you think so?</p>
<p>Thought I do agree that Leon fault was he never took noticed small trouble before become real disaster even he has Luxion. Well can’t blame him he’s not Ryuguin Seiya 😀</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>The Alzer nobles are the problem.  It goes without saying that they aren’t the solution.</p>
<p>Noelle had a lot more power to do something about them and didn’t.  But she has big boobs and likes the MC, so she’s forgiven and rescued.  Marie’s big contribution is following Leon’s orders when she’s in deadly fear that he’ll kill her out of hand if she doesn’t make herself useful (also, she’s a loli-imouto, so she was forgiven by the fans anyway).  Leon can do something about them, but mostly contents himself with just playing around rather than ever getting serious.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>What do you want him to do? Kill them the first chance he got? Ever heard of power vacuum? It will only get worse if he tried solving this in the most extreme way possible first. Unfortunately, most of his antagonists only stop one step before that. Still doesn’t make it okay for him to not try doing things peacefully. </p>
<p>Noelle is forgiven since she tried tackling ACTUAL problems unlike her sister and actually saved lives doing so. Marie is forgiven since she had long since redeemed herself. Her motivations for doing the things she did are very understandable (the girl had a rough life and it’s not like the five belongs to Olivia doo it’s free real estate). Pretty bad decisions, but it’s understandable. </p>
<p>What about the Leila? She’s being a Sakura right now.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>If only someone were keeping an eye on her, someone else could know what she’s getting into.</p>
<p>This is really inexcusable.  After all, Lelia admitted that she hates getting the bad end so much that she used a walkthrough.  Doesn’t it occur to anyone that she’s exactly the kind of person to also rely on the paid cheat item?  It’s an inexcusable lack of basic prudence to leave her to her own devices at this point.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Emile isn’t qualified.  He’d have to reach out to someone who is an experienced adventurer, and then it would probably end up leaking out and getting found out by the Raults given the recent developments (Raults are on-guard for suspicious activity among nobles and other nobles are trying to curry favor to escape culpability).</p>
<p>Lelia could tell Marie or Leon, but they’ve done very little to convince her that they wouldn’t welcome a chance to burn Alzer to the ground (or even sink it into the sea).  Really, Marie should point out to Leon that there was a cheat item in the second game and that Lelia probably bought it since she went so far as to use a walkthrough to completely avoid seeing the bad ends.  They should have kept an eye on her anyway, but there’s no excuse for not watching out for her attempting to recover a cheat item given the circumstances.</p>
<p>Lelia is dumb, but her only good move is to trust the benevolence of the only guy she knows who would cheerfully burn down her country and roast marshmellows over the flames (and has the means, motive, and opportunity to do so).  Yes, he is a better guy than everyone else…but it takes an unusually good judge of character to see that.</p>
<p>She’s not that great a judge of character.</p>

It’s related to the self-fulfilling prophecy types, where their actions to avoid the prophecy are actually the trigger for the prophecy.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>You know Leila, if he wanted to destroy the world or Alzer he would’ve already. Leila thinks things through even less than Marie did. At least Marie tried use her knowledge of the game to the best of her advantage. Leila just goes with the flow but even worse she’s going to unlock some sort of super weapon and make the situation even worse. Also Leon, it’s your fault for letting yourself get cornered.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Caught in the act doesn’t mean caught in THAT act.  Probably.</p>
<p>Also, it doesn’t mean that Marie is the initiator of any of those acts.  It’s probably more a matter of those guys acting lovey dovey towards her while she is desperately trying to keep them presentable.  From certain scenes, it seems like those guys are barely capable of dressing themselves even before considering that they like having her adjust their clothes.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>First and foremost, thank you for the fast translation of Volume 5 of this series. I am always hooked on this since this is my favorite LN at the top so far.<br/>
Leila isn’t really cheating or anything like that; she’s trying to get Serge to assist her since he’s had some adventuring experience than the rest of the Commonwealth. the reason she didn’t tell Emile about this is because it would just complicate things. Her goal is to aqquire the cheat item from the 2nd game to compete on same power as Leon has with Luxion. Honestly, that’s somewhat a sane move to make, given that she’s now seeing him as some unstable threat thanks to understanding Luxion’s main goal of destroying humankind (or new Humans), so you need something to keep that power in check; just in case the worst case senario happens….but yeah, she might do something to f*ck this up and lead to a bigger catastrophy, but we’ll wait for that time to come.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>I mean to be fair that is a pretty sane move considering Leon’s antics. However, if Leila would actually put some thought in it, it would be better to gain his favor rather than be his enemy. She never considered why until Leon hasn’t sunk any islands or anything. Even though it seems like Luxion does everything, it’s not just him. Leon uses Luxion in particular ways that get results, I doubt Leila would be able to do the same. In addition, she isn’t very bright considering how easily Loic fooled her.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, she doesn’t actually know that he hasn’t.  I mean, the rumors about what Leon has done are mostly pretty bad, magnified by the fact that quite recently a large number of people lost their noble status or were driven out of the Kingdom for opposing him.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Lelia isn’t really very smart and particularly lacks a working sense of danger towards the nobles of Alzer other than the Raults.  But compared to Leon, who carried a cartload of idiot balls through much of this arc, and is now failing to supervise the reincarnator with knowledge of the cheat item for this area whom he has just incited to terror, she practically seems like a genius.  Lelia’s idiocy corresponds to Noelle’s, though they are idiotic in different directions.  Frankly I found Noelle’s idiocy more annoying because she had far more power to mitigate her own distress by not being so stupid…but even that is still mostly Leon’s fault.</p>
<p>I think that to some extent Luxion and Creare can be forgiven for not quite getting the whole “otomege world” setup.  In the first place, they don’t really get the tropes underlying otomege, Leon only knew about the first game and Marie’s knowledge has proven pretty spotty.  Lelia’s knowledge must seem similarly worthless, especially in regards to the supposed virtuous potential of the major capture targets.  But Leon doesn’t have that excuse.  He clearly should have been worried about whether there was a cheat item for this game, especially since finding out that Serge was an adventurer rather than being in school.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>well she is too narrow-minded well all of them are they keep getting surprised about game events going out of whack. and she treats the people of otomeverse as digital and non-human so she doesn’t care about their feelings and thinks that emille and serge treat her based on how many events she completes and that outside of alzer is not livable or something as if there is one of those invisible walls you find in video games</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Lelila is really fucking stupid ain’t she? Not only did she keep rationalizing all the stalker shit Loic was doing or not even begin to doubt him when he put a collar on Noelle but now she’s going off with some guy who she apparently knows likes her and he gives off seriously rape-y vibes just from that illustration. And why does she go with him? Because of some casual off hand remark about how Luxion can destroy the entire country in a worst-case scenario of the final boss awakening. Now she has completely thrown the more pressing issue of making sure the final boss doesn’t awaken to the back of her mind and is more focused on getting something to combat Luxion on the the very small chance that he destroys the country. I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if her stupidity is what ends up triggering the final boss.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>well even what we see Noelle twin is troublemaker, but for her something like Luxion/ last boss that can make a mess of her life like destroy her country is dangerous. but sadly, she wasn’t someone with caliber to do so. and she would trigger another bad end route, rather than rely on her boyfriend, she rely more to that Serge, i bet from Emille POV is already considered two timing isn’t it?</p>
<p>I’m curious with her past life, what it is like? and unlike Leon who is get along well with his current family, that girl seem don’t too close with her last surviving family member, even her voice call Noelle ‘big sis’ but her internal voice she call her ‘game heroine’.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Now I’m curious as well. I hope we get Leila route or at last gave her a ss like Marie author-san.</p>
<p>I hope she’s actually evil on the next volume instead keep showing her stupidity or blunder like on this volume. I don’t mind with someone being villain at last do it properly please. From my POV about this series, “Bandel” actually best villain here even Leon tip a hat on him too.</p>
<p>You know anyone can be considered as villain on another people POV this actually can be applied on our IRL too isn’t it?</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>About Leila going to retrieve the cheat item, Guys you are forgetting something: the old mankind technology don’t like new mankind. Remember the dungeons in otome game where the cash items (cheats) that are RUINS of an old civilization (old mankind) like the ruins where Leon found Luxion and Creare. </p>
<p>So my my prediction: another psychopath AI just like Luxion that will not recognize Serge and Leila and will attack them just to be rescue by our MC.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Serge gives me reincarnator vibes, he spends his time looking for adventure, who says he is not looking for cheat items or preparing a backup plan in case his house falls?</p>
<p>It could be a change of the timeline but there is little indication that he has been influenced and pushed outside his original path so i assume he is deviating out of his own will</p>
<p>Also, old tech dont like new humans so there is no way for him to obtain a cheat item unless he is a reincarnator, or if the cheat is another form of magiteck, but those so far have been too unreliable and violent</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>I really hate it when he cowers whenever they accuse him of cheating , they play it as comedy but it’s not funny it’s just annoying … I’m not expecting him to suit up in his armor and fight just look them in the eyes seriously until they quite down shut up sit and then explain everything with a cold disappointed tone</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Because he’s a spineless piece of shit? Every single problem that happens in the story is one of his own making because he’s dense af and a cowardly pushover who’s only able to do anything because he’s surrounded by vastly more competent AIs that basically let him cheat through the story without any real consequences.</p>
<p>He literally lets Noelle get kidnapped, abused, and physically beaten because he’s a spineless coward who can’t commit until he’s forced to. And then he has the gall to act like he’s any better than Loic when he allowed Loic to do all of that. </p>
<p>Like fuck. I thought just maybe he’d gotten a backbone when he rushed in to rescue Ange on a motorcycle, but nope. He’s still a worthless annoyance that would be dead without the cheats that are his AIs.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Okay, I’m not going to disagree with anything else, but you’re being contradictory when you say “And then he has the gall to act like he’s any better than Loic”.</p>
<p>You call him a spineless piece of shit, then get huffy about the times when he actually shows some spine?</p>
<p>Do you not see the inherent problem with what you’re saying?  If a bad guy gets away with anything because of a lack of perfect omniscience on the part of others, then nothing can be done about it, especially standing up to the bad guy, because that would be…what</p>
<p>Spineless?</p>
