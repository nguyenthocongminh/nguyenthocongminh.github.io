<h1>White Glove</h1>
<p>It was only a mere matter of time until the school term would end.</p>
<p>The grade party had become an established custom, but these parties held within the academy were extravagant.</p>
<p>No words could describe the quality and quantity of the cuisine lined up on tables. The boys participated while wearing their school uniforms, but the girls pretty much wore dresses.</p>
<p>The boys ogled the dressed-up girls, who had demi-human slaves stand next to them.</p>
<p>My line of sight automatically locked onto the chests of the girls as well, and I found it hard to avert my gaze.</p>
<p>I cleared my throat and made a serious face.</p>
<p>“Was that chest just now an F cup? That’s not it, I meant to say that the food here is amazing.”</p>
<p>I returned my gaze to the table, where Daniel was eating a large meaty dish on a plate. Raymond was amazed at that sight.</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’ve been to such a large party. The academy is tremendous.”</p>
<p>“Daniel, don’t talk with your mouth full. Thinking about the scale of this party, and how it’s held per grade, the royal capital really does seem tremendous. It’s a lot different from the poor barons in the countryside.”</p>
<p>Luxon had said something to me before.</p>
<p>The academy was doing this to show off the power of the royal capital to those from the countryside. Indeed, just this party alone showed the difference in their wealth.</p>
<p>I believe there’s the possibility that it’s also to show off to the rich, spoiled young nobles.</p>
<p>Surrounding us were boys from the same environment.</p>
<p>Students from the regular class were also participating today, meaning that there were many people participating in the party.</p>
<p>Daniel surveyed our surroundings.</p>
<p>“There are also a lot girls from the regular class who are dressed-up. There are too few girls wearing the uniform.”</p>
<p>Raymond pushed up his glasses.</p>
<p>In front of him was a slender girl whom he took a liking to.</p>
<p>This guy is a taciturn person.</p>
<p>“There’s a wide range of dresses ranging from pricey to cheap. It seems that there are even ones that go for two thousand dia.”</p>
<p>That’s two hundred thousand yen for a suit of clothes! That’s when converted into Japanese currency, though.</p>
<p>Well, I don’t know what’s cheap or expensive, but the lowest cost seemed to be two hundred thousand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marie, the current hot topic, had appeared in her uniform. The surrounding students created a commotion and noisily talked amongst each other.</p>
<p>With this situation at hand, the honor student who wore her uniform as well, Olivia, didn’t stand out at all.</p>
<p>All things considered, a girl from a viscount household should’ve been able to prepare a dress…and as I was thinking of such things, Marie went over to the prince and the others.</p>
<p>The prince’s group, the one that held the highest rank, welcomed Marie, but…</p>
<p>Julian was a bit surprised upon seeing Marie in her uniform.</p>
<p>“Marie, what happened to your dress?”</p>
<p>“U, umm, I couldn’t prepare one.”</p>
<p>Trying to appeal to her, the surrounding boys each said “We could have given you one if you said so,” to Marie.</p>
<p>Jilk smiled.</p>
<p>“This does feel more refreshing than a gorgeous dress, though. Marie, how about we head to a tailor for a dress next time? There’s a shop in the royal capital that I visit regularly.”</p>
<p>“I, I can’t do something rude like that.”</p>
<p>In response to her modest attitude, Julian started a conversation amongst five people while seeming a little excited. It seems that those five are fighting for Marie’s interest.</p>
<p>There’s more apart from that.</p>
<p>For boy mobs like us, this party was also a chance for glory. According to our upperclassmen, it seems that this is an opportunity for couples to form.</p>
<p>“Well then, are you two ready?”</p>
<p>Once I called out to the two, Daniel set down his plate.</p>
<p>“Yep, I’ve eaten enough.”</p>
<p>Raymond adjusted his glasses.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to do our best.”</p>
<p>The three of us immediately began to take action.</p>
<p>We went around inviting girls over.</p>
<p>With the kind of mood set in place here, it was possible that the girls may have become more lenient on letting us marry them. At this point, we were thinking that it would be fine even if our partner had a lover.</p>
<p>“Whoa! I found a trio of girls over there! Let’s hurry and try our luck!”</p>
<p>The other boys were making moves as well, so the three of us headed towards where the girls were, but──</p>
<p>“Huh? Come back when you’ve looked at a mirror.”</p>
<p>“Countryside barons? I don’t need a hillbilly.”</p>
<p>“Bumpkins will be bumpkins, so just go find some bumpkin girls to call out to. We’re only aiming for viscount households at the very minimum. Furthermore, remote regions…are out of the question.”</p>
<p>“How sickening, you boys are desperate for marriage. You can just see how shallow the people at the bottom are.”</p>
<p>“A man isn’t good if they don’t have more assets.”</p>
<p>“There’s a big difference between you and people like his Highness the crown prince.”</p>
<p>The girls lightly brushed us off, and their exclusive servants, their demi-human lovers, looked down on us. Their masters were the girls, and not us. Due to that, there were a lot of slaves that took a dismissive attitude towards boys.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a slave getting attacked would lead to an intense investigation being done.</p>
<p>They knew that they’re in a position safe from assaults, so they looked down on us.</p>
<p>“W, well, we’re just chatting, so──”</p>
<p>One of the girls used her chin to signal a cue to her servant.</p>
<p>Upon which, the muscular, Daruma-like sub-race servant thrust us away. (<em>TLN: Daruma’s are round, stout dolls</em>)</p>
<p>When the surrounding people gathered their sight towards the three of us tumbling, the girls laughed and the boys either laughed along with them or looked at us with sympathy.</p>
<p>“Try again. No wait, it still won’t work out unless you pray to be born as better man in your next life. See ya, bumpkin hillbillies.”</p>
<p>The girls and slaves around looked at us and laughed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">◇</p>
<p>We were outside the party venue.</p>
<p>“Damn it! We got carried away!”</p>
<p>Daniel spoke without trying to conceal his anger.</p>
<p>Raymond, who sat on the bench with his knees under his arms, looked up into the night sky.</p>
<p>“If only we could redo our lives…I suppose that’s all I need to say.”</p>
<p>…This being my second life, I felt a bit mixed.</p>
<p>We heard happy-sounding music and laughter coming from the party venue.</p>
<p>We couldn’t bear with the mood inside the venue, so we went outside to escape. There were girls who laughed upon seeing us in that situation.</p>
<p>The ones who were laughing were the girls in the advanced class and their slaves.</p>
<p>Perhaps pitying us, the girls in the regular class had averted their gazes.</p>
<p>How miserable.</p>
<p>“…I’m kind of fed up with it all.”</p>
<p>Daniel was about to say something towards what I had said, but closed his mouth and looked down.</p>
<p>Raymond was also silent.</p>
<p>As the head of a baron household, I had to marry a noble lady no matter what.</p>
<p>When one owns a household…their legal wife has to be a noble lady. Otherwise, the people around us will go “Isn’t that unbecoming of the household?” and become cold.</p>
<p>My father married Zola because the drawbacks of not doing so were not to be taken lightly. It sometimes became the excuse for starting a war. There would be people saying that our actions don’t match our rank, and that we’re a vile house.</p>
<p>Due to that, the boys became frantic and the girl’s position only strengthened even more…leading to the current situation of the academy.</p>
<p>Us three fellows sat on the bench, and blankly stared into the sky.</p>
<p>“Those girls gave me an unpleasant feeling.”</p>
<p>Danial agreed with what Raymond said.</p>
<p>“I know, right? Boys are scrambling to marry since the world will turn cold towards them if they don’t do so by graduation. The circumstances are way too different from girls, who have time to spare.”</p>
<p>Not all of the girls in the academy were particularly terrible, but the proportion of cruel girls was way too high.</p>
<p>Hence, there were many boys who didn’t find life at the academy pleasing.</p>
<p>I then remembered something detestable.</p>
<p>It was something the upperclassman Rukul said──</p>
<p>“It seems that in the academy, there were boys who got fed up with women, and started chasing after other boys…but they had been smiling before enrolling in the school. Now, they weren’t smiling.”</p>
<p>Daniel and Raymond nodded.</p>
<p>There were boys who left the academy disgusted with women while going for other boys.</p>
<p>It seemed that there were girls who liked romance between boys, like my little sister before I had reincarnated. There’s no saving this world.</p>
<p>Enroll in school→come to hate how cruel women are→go after boys→give fujoshis great joy. Rinse and repeat for each new school year.</p>
<p>Such a cycle happened.</p>
<p>It was pretty much a rotten spiral…I just called it that because it sounded cool. You see, when considering how these sad events repeat each year, I can’t really use the term rotten chain here. No wait, can’t I still use it? (<em>TLN: Based on what I looked up, ‘rotten chain’ refers to the idea that a fujoshi’s children will also be fujoshis, creating a generational chain of them. My guess is that MC labeled the current situation as a spiral instead of chain, but backtracked when realizing that the idea behind calling it a chain still applies to the situation</em>)</p>
<p>Time passed by in silence.</p>
<p>Thereupon, we could not longer hear the musical performance within the party venue.</p>
<p>There was a live musical performance in there. Taking out my pocket watch, I confirmed that it wasn’t yet time for the party to end.</p>
<p>I thought that the performance was taking a break, but when I strained my ears, I couldn’t hear any laughter in the venue either.</p>
<p>I could hear an occasional voice, as if someone was shouting.</p>
<p>“Hey, doesn’t something seem odd?”</p>
<p>Raymond turned his gaze towards the venue once I said that.</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it, there seems to be a strange commotion.”</p>
<p>Daniel got up.</p>
<p>“Should we take a look? We don’t need to go inside if we just peek through a window.”</p>
<p>Raymond stopped him.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be shamed even more than I have already been. If we’re spotted, we’ll be targets of ridicule. Though, I certainly am curious.”</p>
<p>The three of us showed signs of interest, but while we were talking about not going back into the venue, there was a girl who came outside.</p>
<p>The girl looked around, and then rushed over when she noticed us.</p>
<p>She was a girl in a uniform, Olivia.</p>
<p>“Leon! This is serious!”</p>

<p>Thanks for the chapter!! Also, Happy Halloween!!! I see that the Kingdom’s women really are hypocritical and rotten. Not even a patriarchal society would be so uniformly demeaning towards a woman of lower social rank. Sigh, I am surprised that he never thought to get fed up with the situation sooner. He could always forget the unspoken rules bullcrap and just marry a plebeian girl. </p>
<p>Besides, Leon already bought an isolated island and plans to live his life in isolation. At that point, he doesn’t even need to care about the rest of the kingdom, and no one would go out of their way to attack him…….unless they know about the treasure and want to risk everything for an unknown amount of treasure that might not be worthy the costs of the bribing (that used to convince others to allow the attackers to attack Leon) and the small scale war on Leon’s house……..Well, even then, Leon could always use Luxon or just abandon his household rank to masquerade as a plebeian. I just don’t see how he will loose much in all this. </p>
<p>Rather, I want him to discard most of his restraints and show everyone else what it means to p*ss off Leon. This is why I am looking forward to the next 3 chapters.</p>

<p>As usual, MC is the source of his own problems. He’s rich enough, will run his own territory in the future, and live in seclusion—he doesn’t need to get married and he doesn’t need a noble wife. He could marry one of those regular class girls, or Olivia, or one of those country ladies. Or not marry at all. Oh well, we’re getting close to MC unleashing his cheats.</p>

<p>The problem that people aren’t seeing here is that it invites reprimands from neighbouring territories as well as the kingdom as a whole even for a countryside noble like him. Even if he can get by in the short run with cheats, it means his territory will eventually just be alienated. This means worse trade conditions, if trade even continues, less merchanting activities, etc. The territory will have to be self sufficient. Just to simplify globalization and international trade, generally speaking, trade is very good for the economy as a whole and honestly in the long run more practical than just trying to cut everyone off. MC might still go down this route and get by with some other factors by the end like, say, the matriarchal system gets abolished for example, but from an ingame/in series character’s perspective, you’d normally be afraid of such social repercussions.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions.<br/>
One thing, though. Is there something grammatically incorrect with saying “us three”? I used “Us three fellows” in that instance because in the original it was written differently than the usual “the three of us” phrase. The “fellows” part was there in the original Japanese text.</p>

<p>Well, grammatically speaking it isn’t wrong per se. But then while reading it, “The three of us” sounds better IMO. Regarding “fellows”… it should sound perfectly fine while reading it in Japanese, but post translation to English, it might sound out of place sometimes.</p>

<p>I don’t see why Leon has to put up with the girls in this world. He has enough money and enough knowledge about the world to look for items to strengthen his cause and fight the system.</p>
<p>The women of this world born into nobility are too arrogant. And for absolutely nothing. The men and lower class seem to be the ones who go adventuring, with the exception of some main characters like Marie and Angelica (if that’s her name; I honestly forgot) and even then Marie did nothing but played the damsel in distress.</p>
<p>Not to mention his sister whom bought a slave with the money that he procured.</p>
<p>And these girls are basically just tossing him away even though he’s got enough money to found an army just because of his looks.</p>
