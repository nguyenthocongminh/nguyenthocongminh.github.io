<h1>Extra Story – Rude and Rauda</h1>
<p>.</p>
<p>The cemetery of Fanoss House territory.</p>
<p>The new tomb that was prepared beside both her parents belonged to her little sister Hertrauda.</p>
<p>It was decorated with many flowers. Her elder sister Hertrude also placed a flower bouquet there.</p>
<p>「Rauda──I can finally visit.」</p>
<p>The duke house was busy after they lost the war.</p>
<p>From a princess, now Hertrude was a duchess. Her days were busy as the acting duke.</p>
<p>Because of that, she was unable to visit the grave until now.</p>
<p>Hertrude shed tears.</p>
<p>「I wonder why it turned out like this. Even though originally I should be the one who died while Hertrauda survive. How can I be the one who survive.」</p>
<p>There were also the maids who took care of Rauda and her guardian knights at some distance away.</p>
<p>Originally it should be Rauda who survived.</p>
<p>Because of that the number of people who took assisted Hertrauda numbered a lot more than Hertrude.</p>
<p>But right now they were assisting Hertrude.</p>
<p>「Everyone is gone. Father, mother, and even Bandel are gone. Onee-chan is all alone if even Rauda is gone.」</p>
<p>When they were children, they decided to use the magic flute in order to take revenge against the kingdom.</p>
<p>The user would die if they summoned the guardian deity.</p>
<p>That was why Hertrude volunteered herself in order to protect Rauda who was younger than her.</p>
<p>「Actually I should be──and yet I’m the one who live.」</p>
<p>After losing their parents, they only had each other as family.</p>
<p>Sometimes they also quarreled, but they would reconcile right away.</p>
<p>Her previous little sister Rauda──Hertrauda, she wanted her little sister to live.</p>
<p>Hertrude remembered the time before they proclaimed war toward the kingdom.</p>
<p>That day, Rauda came to her room and said she wanted to sleep together.</p>
<p>She accepted and the two of them sisters slept together after so long.</p>
<p>Even now Hertrude could recall Rauda’s face that was crying when she saw her off.</p>
<p>「If only, I was smarter」</p>
<p>Thinking back now, they were just used by their retainers as they pleased.</p>
<p>Hertrude burst into tears and clung on the gravestone.</p>
<p>「Rauda, I’m sorry. Because Onee-chan is unreliable, you became a sacrifice──I’m really sorry.」</p>
<p>Just where did they go wrong?</p>
<p>The people around left alone Hertrude who was crying in front of her little sister’s grave.</p>
<p>Amidst those people, a man who was dispatched from the kingdom looked at his pocket watch and spoke.</p>
<p>「Acting duke, it’ll be time soon.」</p>
<p>The man informed that it was the time to return to work. The people around him protested.</p>
<p>「Be more flexible for this kind of time at least.」</p>
<p>「There is no way you don’t know how long Hertrude-sama has been waiting for this.」</p>
<p>「This is why the kingdom’s people is just」</p>
<p>The principality──the duke house’s people defended Hertrude.</p>
<p>But, the man who was dispatched from the kingdom made a cold expression.</p>
<p>「The procedure in the kingdom will be slowed if the affairs here are delayed. Besides, I wish that you all can be thankful just from me allowing you to take time for this kind of chore.」</p>
<p>Both countries were at war just a little while ago.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the kingdom’s people, they wouldn’t care about the circumstance of Fanoss House at all.</p>
<p>「A lot of people died in the territories that were trampled by all of you. This result came from your own doing.」</p>
<p>The man didn’t hold any positive feeling toward the duke house.</p>
<p>In the first place, it would also be a bother for the kingdom to spend effort to crush Fanoss House.</p>
<p>They simply let them live. That was the kingdom’s attitude.</p>
<p>Hertrude wiped her tears and stood up before returning to the carriage.</p>
<p>「Excuse me. Let’s return quickly.」</p>
<p>The people of the duke house looked down with frustration welling up inside them hearing that.</p>
<p>The man who was dispatched from the kingdom scoffed.</p>
<p>「Very well. I wish that you will be obedient to the kingdom from here on too. Well, even if you oppose us, I don’t think the Fanoss House right now will be able to do anything though.」</p>
<p>「You!」</p>
<p>One knight was about to punch the man, but Hetrude stopped him.</p>
<p>「Stop! ──My apologies. Let’s hurry to the castle.」</p>
<p>When Hetrude hurried toward the carriage, the man turned toward the knight and said.</p>
<p>「If something happen to me, Count Bartfalt will be dispatched next. Do you have the resolve for that?」</p>
<p>The knights of the duke house averted their faces when Leon’s name came out.</p>
<p>But, Hertrude knew──.</p>
<p>(A small fry who is getting full of himself by hiding behind Count Bartfalt’s name.)</p>
<p>──That Leon wouldn’t march against the Duke House just from this much.</p>
<p>Hertrude got into the carriage and gazed outside the window. She recalled when she went into an adventure before.</p>
<p>She only entered a ruin in the elf’s village, even so that memory felt really nostalgic right now.</p>
<p>(Come to think of it, the village chief told me at that time.)</p>
<p>If you can walk together with your fated partner──when she recalled the result of the fortune-telling, it would be Leon’s face that came to mind no matter what.</p>
<p>(──Would my fate change if I persuaded him more seriously?)</p>
<p>Rauda would still be alive, and Leon would be here──would the principality be able to continue as it was and not getting reduced into a duke house?</p>
<p>Hertrude imagined that, but she immediately shook her head.</p>
<p>(No good. I have to get a hold of myself right now.)</p>
<p>Hertrude couldn’t just keep grieving for the sake of the duke house.</p>
<p>While the cemetery was getting distant, Hertrude talked to Hertrauda and others inside her heart.</p>
<p>(Rauda──and Bandel. Please watch over us together with father, mother, and everyone else.)</p>
