<h1>Epilogue</h1>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p>Curtis, a scholarship student in the kingdom’s academy came to the male toilet.</p>
<p>He intended to arrange his hairstyle using the mirror in the boy dormitory’s toilet.</p>
<p>However, there was a preceding visitor there.</p>
<p>「Oh, aren’t you──」</p>
<p>When he called that person, the person stuffed something into his pocket in surprise to hide it.</p>
<p>「N-no, this isn’t how it looks like!」</p>
<p>Curtis smiled to calm down the flustered person.</p>
<p>「I won’t tease a boy who is concerned about his own appearance you know?」</p>
<p>This person did something in front of the mirror before he entered, but surely he was only doing something to tidy up his appearance just like what he planned to do.</p>
<p>That person──Aaron looked embarrassed.</p>
<p>But, it was there Curtis felt something out of place.</p>
<p>(It doesn’t look like he has just arranged his hair style──more importantly, his lips looks really glossy.)</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like lipstick, but those lips were too vivacious for a boy.</p>
<p>In addition was Aaron’s hairstyle.</p>
<p>Previously his hairstyle looked wilder, manlier, and yet recently his hairstyle was set to be neat and tidy.</p>
<p>His previously slovenly way of dressing had also become neater.</p>
<p>This person had a slightly rough attitude before. He was a type that Curtis wasn’t really good with but──the current Aaron looked more graceful and tactful than before.</p>
<p>Aaron seemed to notice that Curtis’s gaze was looking at his lips. He hurriedly made an excuse.</p>
<p>「T-t-t-this is lip cream!」</p>
<p>「Lip cream?」</p>
<p>「You know, your lips will feel chapped when the air is dry right!? I’m using some cream to prevent that.」</p>
<p>「I-I see.」</p>
<p>(Is the air really that dry even though it’s not winter anymore? He must have it rough.)</p>
<p>Aaron looked embarrassed when Curtis sent him a worried glance and he left the male toilet.</p>
<p>「S-sorry to take your time. I’m leaving now.」</p>
<p><em>I’m leaving now</em>──those words also gave him an out-of-place feeling. Males would often use those words too, but the way Aaron said them just now felt strangely feminine.</p>
<p>Curtis followed Aaron’s disappearing back before he noticed another strange thing.</p>
<p>「Hm?」</p>
<p>Aaron bumped into a male acquaintance just as he got out of the toilet.</p>
<p>「Aaron, you look pretty too today.」</p>
<p>「Geez, everyone keep saying that.」</p>
<p>A lot of 「!?」 mark floated above Curtis’s head.</p>
<p>(W-what’s this? Why is Aaron that intimate with a male student? I thought he was chasing around female students before──)</p>
<p>He remembered seeing Aaron hitting on female students in the academy together with other students who looked like delinquent.</p>
<p>But there was something strange with the current Aaron.</p>
<p>(Thinking back, recently it feels like he is always together with other boys──d-don’t tell me)</p>
<p>Curtis felt a slight chill on his back.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p>It was noisy in Marie’s mansion since the morning.</p>
<p>「Is the breakfast not done yet~?」</p>
<p>Greg was sleepily lying on the table while demanding breakfast. Kyle made snide remark seeing Greg like that.</p>
<p>「The breakfast will finish faster if only Greg-san will help us out.」</p>
<p>「I’m an eating specialist. Besides, you should tell that to Baltfalt too.」</p>
<p>I was also waiting for the breakfast to be served while doing nothing.</p>
<p>However Kyle shook his head.</p>
<p>「The count is different because he paid the food expenses.」</p>
<p>──The power of money is truly mighty. I don’t get scolded even while I’m doing nothing to help.</p>
<p>Julius and Jilk also entered the dining room while I was waiting.</p>
<p>「What is the plan for today?」</p>
<p>「There will be questioning in the embassy. It looks like the kingdom dispatched someone to investigate about the incident this time.」</p>
<p>The two of them were talking about work right from the morning. The next one who appeared after them was Brad whose injuries were almost healed.</p>
<p>「What is it for breakfast today?」</p>
<p>He asked Cara who came to place the plates on the table.</p>
<p>But Cara yelled angrily at him.</p>
<p>「Please don’t get in my way! Come on, sit on your seat everyone!」</p>
<p>Kyle and Cara were coming and going between the kitchen and the dining hall busily.</p>
<p>The voice of Marie──and Noelle could be heard from the kitchen.</p>
<p>「Noelle, take care of that one please!」</p>
<p>「Okay~」</p>
<p>Noelle had the appearance like a gal, and yet she was good with all kinds of housework.</p>
<p>Was this what they called gap moe?</p>
<p>Chris also came dripping with sweat while we were waiting.</p>
<p>「That was a good work out.</p>
<p>Greg complained seeing Chris sweaty like that.</p>
<p>「You’re making the morning feel sweltering looking like that. Go take a shower first.」</p>
<p>「You yourself doesn’t look fully awake. How about you go wash your face first before saying that?」</p>
<p>Brad shrugged seeing the two readying themselves to fight.</p>
<p>「You two are energetic right from the morning. Well, this is just like you two musclebrains.」</p>
<p>Greg and Chris changed focus to Brad after hearing that.</p>
<p>「It’ll be better if you train yourself a bit more though.」</p>
<p>「Yeah. If you do that then you won’t end up like this time.」</p>
<p>Brad pointed at the two of them and retorted back.</p>
<p>「You two also wouldn’t be able to do anything if you were the one at my place!」</p>
<p>Marie entered the noisy dining hall and lifted up a fry pan that she hit with a ladle in place of a bell.</p>
<p>「Come on be quiet all of you! The breakfast will be served so eat without complaining!」</p>
<p>She was like a childcare worker who was taking care of kindergarteners.</p>
<p>The foods that were served on the dining table were corn soup and──toasts that looked familiar to me.</p>
<p>「Ah, this is」</p>
<p>I thought they looked nostalgic. It was something that my mother in my past life often made for breakfast.</p>
<p>The toast had a sunny-side up fried egg and two bacons placed on it──even the arrangement was the same like my mother’s toast.</p>
<p>I was wondering whether Marie also remembered mother’s cooking while feeling very nostalgic.</p>
<p>Noelle came to my side.</p>
<p>「Leon, there is an excess bacon so I’ll give you one more.」</p>
<p>「Is that alright?」</p>
<p>「It’s alright.」</p>
<p>Julius who was eating his toast saw that I was the only one with extra bacon and became jealous.</p>
<p>「Only Bartfalt got the special treatment? I’m jealous.」</p>
<p>It made me felt really deplorable thinking that there was really a prince who would say something like that.</p>
<p>「You’ve been eating tasty things in the palace since childhood haven’t you? Just endure a bit with your own portion.」</p>
<p>「This is because all of Marie’s cooking are novel foods. They’re also delicious! That’s why I’m jealous.」</p>
<p>Julius was suddenly boasting about his lover. What would be the right answer to give him here?</p>
<p>When I looked toward Marie, she had already finished her egg and bacons and brought a new toast from the kitchen to the table. She was having seconds even in breakfast. It made me really curious just where she was saving that much food inside that small body.</p>
<p>「Uhyoooo! This slightly expensive jam spread really well on the bread.」</p>
<p>She chose the jam she liked from among the jam bottles that were lined up on the table and spread it on her bread before eating the toast.</p>
<p>「Haa~ being able to choose jam in the morning is happiness」</p>
<p>It seemed she was feeling happiness from having different types of jams, but as for me──I felt like crying.</p>
<p>「You can, taste happiness just from this much?」</p>
<p>She had become a very simple woman.</p>
<p>Even though in our past life she was the type of woman who would pester me for money to travel abroad…</p>
<p>Cara was begging Marie for the jam.</p>
<p>「Marie-sama, I want the orange jam!」</p>
<p>「Okay. Spread a lot of it on your bread. We have a lot of breads and jams!」</p>
<p>Kyle was spreading blueberry jam on his bread.</p>
<p>「──Not having to worry about your meal is happiness.」</p>
<p>Why did eating with Marie’s group was making me wanted to cry like this?</p>
<p>I stopped thinking about it and focused on eating the nostalgic breakfast. Then Noelle peered onto my face.</p>
<p>「Leon, the corner of your mouth got something on it.」</p>
<p>「Relaly? I’ll wipe it later so it’s fine.」</p>
<p>「Don’t do that. You’re a count, so you need to act properly.」</p>
<p>She said that and wiped the corner of my mouth for me.</p>
<p>A gal who was considerate and attentive was really great.</p>
<p>I might fall in love with her if I didn’t already have Ange and Livia.</p>
<p>Julius seemed like he wasn’t used with eating toast and the area around his mouth got dirty. He was bothered by it.</p>
<p>「The toast is delicious, but it’s easy for the pan to crumble and leaving behind scraps.」</p>
<p>Jilk was also of the same opinion.</p>
<p>「Indeed. Isn’t there any way to prevent this from happening?」</p>
<p>Greg who was heartily eating his portion gave the two of them advice.</p>
<p>「Just eat the food without worrying about that.」</p>
<p>The breakfast was really lively.</p>
<p>Noelle was smiling.</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「I’m just having fun somehow. I was always eating breakfast with my little sister, but it has been a long time since I have this much fun.」</p>
<p>「──Did something happen?」</p>
<p>I had heard that her relationship with her little sister wasn’t going well, but Noelle didn’t talk much about it.</p>
<p>「Well, various things happened. But Lelia herself is also worrying about me.」</p>
<p>So even twins got their own problem.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p>The mansion where Marie’s group was living was a splendid one.</p>
<p>It also had a reception room in it that could be used to serve visiting guest.</p>
<p>There were sofas inside the room with a low table placed between them. A full set of furniture was also placed inside the room so that it wouldn’t be discourteous toward the guest.</p>
<p>It must be the embassy that prepared them.</p>
<p>I got the impression that they spent money for the necessary things so that there wouldn’t be any problem occurring because Julius was also living here.</p>
<p>My own house also had a reception room, but it wasn’t as splendid as this room in Marie’s mansion.</p>
<p>Right now I was preparing tea for a guest inside that room.</p>
<p>「──E-enjoy.」</p>
<p>「Thank you for the tea.」</p>
<p>The figure sitting on the sofa while drinking the tea elegantly looked very beautiful.</p>
<p>For those who didn’t know about this person’s personality, she would only look like a noble lady.</p>
<p>The girl──no, she had already graduated from the academy, so I should call her a woman, she had long blonde hair that was styled into ringlets.</p>
<p>Her name was Deirdre Fou Roseblade.</p>
<p>She was an upperclassman I was acquainted with.</p>
<p>「It has been a long time since I have your tea. Has your skill become slightly better?」</p>
<p>This person wasn’t the type to say flattery, so she must have really enjoyed the tea.</p>
<p>「Perhaps it’s because Alzer’s tea leaves that are delicious?」</p>
<p>「Is that so? Then perhaps I’ll buy some for souvenir when going home.」</p>
<p>Deirdre-senpai drank her tea happily. But still, why was she coming to Alzer?</p>
<p>──I didn’t know why.</p>
<p>「Err, could it be you are in a trip right now?」</p>
<p>Deirdre-senpai smiled at me.</p>
<p>「How rude. I come here for work even though I look like this. His majesty asked me 『I want you to examine the situation in Alzer right now』. That’s right, I’m also asked by his majesty to give you a letter.」</p>
<p>I received the letter and read the content.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>『How dare you caused a trouble in Alzer, you shitty brat. We are short of manpower right now so we even have to recruit students who are fresh out of academy. Oops, on that topic, it seems that the girl I dispatched is your acquaintance isn’t it? ──Get along well with her. Though I’ll tell Redgrave House if you have an affair there!   By your magnificent king』</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I expressionlessly tore the letter.</p>
<p>Deirdre-senpai seemed to guess the content of the letter from my reaction and smiled pleasantly.</p>
<p>「You’re really on good terms with his majesty.」</p>
<p>「Ahahaha! ──Indeed. We are so close that we want to punch each other’s face.」</p>
<p>If I could I wanted to bury my fist into Roland’s face right now.</p>
<p>Setting that aside, it seemed Deirdre-senpai was dispatched here in order to investigate the case this time.</p>
<p>There was a bit of problem with her personality, but it seemed she intended to do her job properly.</p>
<p>「I have heard about the situation in general at the embassy. I heard how a son of a great noble picked a fight with you and you beat him up thoroughly in a duel──it sent me shivers to hear that.」</p>
<p>Deirdre-senpai blushed and put her index finger on her lips──she was a pervert.</p>
<p>「As expected from the kingdom’s hero. You even beat up the six great nobles and contributed in elevating the kingdom’s standing. How wonderful. ──It has been a long time since my heart beat this fast.」</p>
<p>How should I reply to Deirdre-senpai who had this look of ecstasy in her face?</p>
<p>「──Are you coming here today just for a greeting?」</p>
<p>「How can that be. I come bringing souvenir for you. ──Don’t you want to know the action that Alzer is taking in regard with this case? I have information that you can’t learn as an oversea student here.」</p>
<p>It seemed she would tell me an information that she learned from her work.</p>
<p>Luxion was also gathering information for me, but let’s at least listened to what she had because she was doing this out of the kindness of her heart.</p>
<p>「Is there any interesting information?」</p>
<p>「The kingdom demanded Alzer to hand over Pierre who inflicted his highness Julius with a curse. But they didn’t comply and rejected the demand.」</p>
<p>「Is Faiviel House protecting Pierre?」</p>
<p>I thought that sounded plausible, but Deirdre-senpai was chukling in response.</p>
<p>「Your relationship with your family must be good. You were raised in a warm household weren’t you?」</p>
<p>「Eh? No, my relationship with my sisters aren’t that good──」</p>
<p>「This Pierre who caused all these problems, it looked like he planned to remove his big brother who will be the next head and become the head of the house himself. It seemed the next house head got furious from that.」</p>
<p>──Protectionless.</p>
<p>Noble who got their divine protection taken away would be disdained as protectionless in the commonwealth.</p>
<p>There were several reasons for that. One of them was that the sacred tree had turned its back on them.</p>
<p>I also heard that the descendant of someone whose divine protection had been taken away would never be able to obtain divine protection themselves.</p>
<p>In other words, Pierre’s life as a noble was finished completely.</p>
<p>He couldn’t even be used for political marriage anymore.</p>
<p>──I drove him into a corner even knowing that.</p>
<p>「Is he imprisoned? Or perhaps he got “sick” or something?」</p>
<p>Deirdre-senpai took off her eyes from me and began to fiddle with her ringlets.</p>
<p>「They said he committed suicide to take responsibility. But from how furious the next head was, it’s possible that he is being imprisoned underground somewhere and tortured there.」</p>
<p>「Alzer’s noble is cold toward their own family.」</p>
<p>「I think it’s the same even in Hohlfahrt.」</p>
<p>Was this what they called the dark part of nobility? I absolutely didn’t want to get involved with it.</p>
<p>「──Didn’t you corner him like that while knowing such fate might be waiting for him?」</p>
<p>Deirdre-senpai asked me like that. I couldn’t say that I didn’t feel guilt.</p>
<p>But, everything was Pierre’s own responsibility.</p>
<p>「He reaped what he sow. That’s all there is to it. To begin with, after doing something like that to our stupid prince, I have to settle the score with him. ──It was Pierre who started it.」</p>
<p>Deirdre-senpai was also a noble’s daughter. She looked satisfied by my answer.</p>
<p>「Good. If you say something like, <em>I didn’t intend to go that far</em> and regret it, then I’ll have to slap you.」</p>
<p>──If it was Livia here, would she be angry?</p>
<p>Deirdre-senpai told me more information.</p>
<p>「Other than that, the academy will also reopen without accident. All of you should continue your study there like before. However, please be very careful.」</p>
<p>「Ee~, I’m the one who have to be careful?」</p>
<p>「Of course you have to. I will return immediately to bring this information back to the kingdom, but another person should be dispatched for the actual negotiation.」</p>
<p>This was an international problem after all. If they were going to negotiate, they had to prepare the proper officials.</p>
<p>My previous negotiation with the six great nobles in the end was only my personal negotiation.</p>
<p>Deirdre-senpai stood up.</p>
<p>「I’m busy even though it looks like I’m free, so excuse me for now. Ah, that’s right」</p>
<p>When I stood up to see her off, Deirdre-senpai handed me two pieces of letters.</p>
<p>「Send words to them properly. They were really worried you know?」</p>
<p>These were letters from Ange and Livia.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p>『Leon-san, are you well? Are you injured or sick? Are you eating properly?』</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Tears were coming out while I was reading the letter from Livia who was worried for me.</p>
<p>Ange’s letter was also similar.</p>
<p>She wrote to me that if something happened in Alzer, just run away and returned back safely.</p>
<p>She was more worried for my safety rather than honor. It was an unusual stance for a noble.</p>
<p>I carefully folded the letters and kept them properly inside the table’s drawer.</p>
<p>Luxion who was watching me looked slightly apologetic.</p>
<p>『──My main body got closer to the commonwealth just in case there was an emergency. Currently it’s impossible to communicate using mail.』</p>
<p>Luxion acted as relay to exchange mails while he was stationed in the halfway point between the kingdom and the commonwealth.</p>
<p>But currently his main body had drawn near to the commonwealth and the exchange of mails became impossible due to various factors like magic element’s density and the like.</p>
<p>「I’ve come to grips with it because it can’t be helped. When will you return your main body to its original position?」</p>
<p>『That depends on the situation. It’s still on standby in the commonwealth even now. There is also the repair and resupply for Einhorn and Arroganz.』</p>
<p>Currently Luxion was in the middle of cleaning Einhorn and Arroganz that got dirtied by Pierre’s decoration.</p>
<p>「I guess I’ll write another letter. I should send some souvenir too.」</p>
<p>『That will be good.』</p>
<p>I sat on the chair and looked up to the ceiling. Then Luxion talked to me.</p>
<p>『──Is Pierre’s fate weighing on master’s mind?』</p>
<p>「It’s that guy’s own fault.」</p>
<p>Everything that he had done until now was befalling himself now. That was all.</p>
<p>I got no sympathy for him. But, it was the fact that I was the one who cornered him into that.</p>
<p>『Master, actually there is one thing that is bothering me──』</p>
<p>Just when Luxion was about to say something, the room’s door was opened roughly and Marie entered with a yell.</p>
<p>「Big broooo!」</p>
<p>I narrowed my eyes toward Marie.</p>
<p>「At least knock before entering.」</p>
<p>「It’s fine. I don’t have any interest in whatever big bro might be doing! Ah!? That’s not it! A-actually there is a guest!」</p>
<p>「Again」</p>
<p>While I was thinking who was it this time, Marie waved her hands around while saying.</p>
<p>「It’s Lelia! What’s more that girl──is a reincarnator!」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>I couldn’t comprehend what Marie was saying.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p>Noelle was also there when I entered the reception room.</p>
<p>「Ah, Leon」</p>
<p>It seemed they were talking about something, but it didn’t look like the topic of the talk was really pleasant.</p>
<p>Noelle’s expression was cloudy, while Lelia was glaring at me and Marie.</p>
<p>Then her eyes opened wide when she noticed Luxion floating on my right shoulder.</p>
<p>She was clearly on her guard and seemed to know about Luxion.</p>
<p>「Noelle──can you let us talk with your sister for a bit?」</p>
<p>「I don’t mind but」</p>
<p>Noelle looked toward Lelia. In respond Lelia crossed her legs with a brazen expression as though to say <em>bring it on</em>.</p>

<p>「It’s okay. It looks like big sis has been in your debt, and I also have many things to say.」</p>
<p>Lelia folded her arms. Noelle looked like she didn’t know what to say to her.</p>
<p>「Lelia, don’t say anything uncalled for to them.」</p>
<p>After Noelle left the room, Marie looked alternately between my face and Lelia’s with a troubled look.</p>
<p>I asked straight to Lelia.</p>
<p>「Are you a reincarnator too?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. I was reincarnated as the main character’s twin little sister. ──Even though I had my own plans, all of them are now messed up because of you guys.」</p>
<p>「I apologize about that.」</p>
<p>I sat on the sofa with Marie following to sit beside me.</p>
<p>Luxion looked at Lelia.</p>
<p>『And, what are you looking for that you come here?』</p>
<p>Lelia turned her gaze from Luxion to me.</p>
<p>「How do you have a cheat item with you?」</p>
<p>「I worked hard to get him.」</p>
<p>「──Well, it’s not really my business.」</p>
<p>Lelia looked discontent with my answer. Even so she talked about the reason she came to our mansion.</p>
<p>「I’m asking you to return big sis to me. Together with the sacred tree’s sapling if possible.」</p>
<p>The way she spoke was one-sided that Marie got irritated instead of me.</p>
<p>「Haa? Why do we have to follow your instruction?」</p>
<p>「The sacred tree’s sapling will wither if it’s not being hold by big sis who has the aptitude as the priestess! Do you two not even know that? The development from now will all go wrong if the sapling withered!」</p>
<p>That must be something that Lelia couldn’t allow from where she was standing.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like I had a problem with her demand but──there was one thing that bothered me.</p>
<p>「Priestess aptitude? Wait a second, don’t you also have that aptitude?」</p>
<p>Lelia’s wording bothered me that I tried asking her. In respond her gaze to me clearly turned into a ridiculing gaze.</p>
<p>「I don’t have the aptitude. Big sis is the only one with the aptitude to become the priestess.」</p>
<p>Marie started breaking into cold sweat.</p>
<p>「Eh, wait. Wait a second. Aren’t you two twins? It shouldn’t be strange for the two of you two have the aptitude. You know, just like how you two split the twintail to become matching side tail with each other.」</p>
<p>Lelia said 「Our hair style doesn’t have anything to do with it!」 before talking about the priestess’s aptitude.</p>
<p>「Before Lespinasse House was destroyed, my parents said that big sis is the only one with the priestess aptitude while I have none.」</p>
<p>I was shaken hearing that and turned my gaze toward Luxion.</p>
<p>『There was a mention in the document of the six great nobles that the priestess was decided based on bloodline though?』</p>
<p>Lelia denied Luxion’s information.</p>
<p>「My parents, the previous priestess and guardian said that I don’t have the aptitude. It’s impossible for them to be wrong. Besides, the priestess carries the role to connect the sacred tree with the people. The priestess said that I don’t have the aptitude, so obviously she is in the right rather than some document somewhere.」</p>
<p>Lelia’s assertion made Marie and I to hold our head in our wits’ end.</p>
<p>「No way. Our plan to make Lelia the priestess and Emile the guardian-」</p>
<p>「Luxion you liarrrrr!」</p>
<p>Lelia looked at us in disgust.</p>
<p>「Do you understand just how much I have prepared until now? My house was burned and I got chased away when I was a child, after that I worked hard to look after big sis until we came to the academy. I thought that big sis can finally become Loic’s lover and the danger to the world would be averted, and yet」</p>
<p>She was saying things that caught my attention.</p>
<p>「Wait a second. Could it be, you are the one who set Loic after Noelle?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. The true end of the second game was also centered around Loic. It’s big sis’s fate to be together with Loic.」</p>
<p>True end──was that the one you called the true ending? It seemed that the best conclusion of that otome game’s sequel was where Noelle and Loic became together.</p>
<p>I made a complicated expression. Seeing that Lelia said 「What? Got any complaint?」.</p>
<p>「It’s more a question than a complaint. Noelle, she hates Loic doesn’t she?」</p>
<p>I asked for agreement from Marie.</p>
<p>「Yeah. I think Loic is the only one that she won’t want to be with. Because she looks like she really hate him. I’ve seen something like that before. Her hate looks like it’s already at the level that it’s physiologically impossible for her to accept him. I think it’s absolutely impossible for those two to become lovers.」</p>
<p>If someone that I liked told me something like 「it’s physiologically impossible for me to be with you」, I wouldn’t be able to get back on my feet for three days.</p>
<p>Lelia was also a woman, so it seemed she get what Marie was talking about.</p>
<p>「B-but, in that otome game, big sis and Loic were──」</p>
<p>Marie stared at Lelia with a face of comprehension.</p>
<p>「In this world we won’t need to go through any hardship if things can progress just like in the game.」</p>
<p>Marie’s words were surely filled with various meanings.</p>
<p>It made a bit sad.</p>
<p>「You have gone through a lot of hardships until now. Though the cause of your failure was because you aimed to have reverse harem.」</p>
<p>Marie wiped her eyes with her sleeve.</p>
<p>「Don’t say it. I’m regretting it already.」</p>
<p>Then Lelia said.</p>
<p>「Ha? No way? Don’t tell me, you aimed for something like reverse harem? Uwa~, aiming for reverse harem in real world , you’re unbelievable.」</p>
<p>Marie strongly objected after seeing Lelia’s appalled look.</p>
<p>「Shut up! If there is happiness just lying around over there, then it’s only human to pick it up! Besides, even you also laid your hand on that safe tile Emile!」</p>
<p>「I sincerely chose only one person!」</p>
<p>「Hah! Sincere you say? You only chose him because you knew that he was someone rich from a good family weren’t you? It’s laughable that you call that being sincere.」</p>
<p>As fellow woman──they were able to guess what each other was thinking. It ended up becoming a horrible exchange of insult.</p>
<p>「I’m still better than you who aimed for reverse harem!」</p>
<p>「You were only narrowing down your target to one person, but what you did is basically the same like me!」</p>
<p>「Don’t group me with you!」</p>
<p>The two were escalating and they proceeded into starting a cat fight.</p>
<p>They grabbed the other’s hair, grabbed the other’s clothes, and insulted each other.</p>
<p>What came to my mind while watching the state of the two was,</p>
<p>「Uwaa~, this is ugly.」</p>
<p>『I agree.』</p>
<p>Marie and Lelia finally ran out of breath and stopped their quarrel. I got the talk back into the right track then.</p>
<p>「Well, in any case all of us here wish to avoid the danger to the world. We should be able to work together.」</p>
<p>Based from this talk with Lelia, it seemed like she also wanted to avoid the danger to the world.</p>
<p>Then we reincarnators shouldn’t fight each other.</p>
<p>「What do you mean working together? You crushed Pierre’s event and separate big sis from Loic.」</p>
<p>I watched Lelia putting her messed up hair and uniform in order while giving an insincere apology.</p>
<p>「Sorry. But it can’t be helped because Pierre picked a fight with us. We also have our own position to think about. As for Loic, he is giving off this dangerous vibe. We’re just saying that it’s better to not choose him.」</p>
<p>「Loic’s desire to monopolize is just a bit strong. It’s also his charm. He will calm down a bit if big sis becomes his lover.」</p>
<p>A bit? That was a bit!? ──I really don’t get girl.</p>
<p>Lelia complained to me.</p>
<p>「More importantly, it’s a problem that you crushed Pierre’s event! That event was really important you know!? What’s more, will you normally corner someone until that far!? I heard from Emile, that Pierre right now is in a really bad situation!」</p>
<p>It seemed Lelia saw the duel. She was looking appalled.</p>
<p>「It was Pierre’s fault for picking a fight with me. Besides, it’s true I cornered him, but he was ruined because of his own habitual bad deeds. That’s not my fault. To begin with it’s his own fault for getting cornered.」</p>
<p>「You’re the worst.」</p>
<p>Marie got up while Lelia was glaring at me.</p>
<p>「Pierre has nothing that worth giving him any sympathy though? Well, just forget about him, you should work together with us.」</p>
<p>We could work together because both sides had the same objective.</p>
<p>Lelia also looked dissatisfied, but she might wanted our cooperation too because she accepted this talk.</p>
<p>「──Anyway, return back big sis and the sacred tree’s sapling.」</p>
<p>I took out the case that was filled with sapling-chan. I had brought it with me because I thought it would be necessary in our discussion.</p>
<p>I placed it on the low table.</p>
<p>「You don’t need to worry if it’s about this thing. It’s placed inside a special case, so it won’t wither for now──e-eh?」</p>
<p>My right hand started shining.</p>
<p>At the same time it felt like sapling-chan was also shining.</p>
<p>「Big bro, the back of your right hand!」</p>
<p>Marie suddenly said that, so I looked at the back of my right hand. There, some kind of crest was forming.</p>
<p>「What’s this!? Hey, what’s this!!?」</p>
<p>Lelia who was watching me kicking a fuss made a face as though she was watching an unbelievable scene.</p>
<p>「W-why!? Why is the “guardian’s crest” is forming on this guy’s hand!?」</p>
<p>Luxion spoke in enjoyment while watching us making a ruckus.</p>
<p>『Oh, this thing has a discerning eye. It seems the sacred tree’s sapling has deemed my master to be worthy as the guardian and choose him.』</p>
<p>「MEEEEE!?」</p>
<p>Sapling-chan chose me as its guardian even though it still hadn’t chosen the priestess.</p>
<p>Originally it should be Noelle──the main character who chose the guardian from among the capture targets, but for some reason it was the sapling itself who chose me.</p>
<p>There was a limit even in being unexpected.</p>
<p>──Oi, what will happen from now!?</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p>At the academy of Hohlfahrt Kingdom.</p>
<p>Livia and Ange were having tea with grave expressions.</p>
<p>Creare was floating near the two of them.</p>
<p>『That sourpuss Luxion is still not contacting.』</p>
<p>Livia who was praying for Leon’s safety from here looked down in worry.</p>
<p>「Do you think our letters has reached Leon-san?」</p>
<p>Ange was drinking her tea calmly, but she was also feeling concerned at the inside.</p>
<p>「Despite her appearances, Deirdre is a woman who keeps her promise. She will deliver our letter without fail.」</p>
<p>However that was only if the situation was one where the letter could be delivered.</p>
<p>The two of them didn’t know how Leon was doing right now in this situation where there was no information coming from the commonwealth.</p>
<p>They wished they could quickly head to the commonwealth personally, but they were ordered to stay put because the situation there was unknown.</p>
<p>「──She should be arriving in Alzer around this time.」</p>
<p>They were able to exchange letters frequently before because of Luxion, but normally obtaining information would take a long time just like now.</p>
<p>Creare consoled the two worried girls.</p>
<p>『It will be fine. Master is someone tenacious, and I don’t think that there is enemy there that can defeat Luxion. Surely they are just busy with taking care of the troublesome matters.』</p>
<p>Livia nodded.</p>
<p>「I hope that’s the case here.」</p>
<p>Ange sighed slightly.</p>
<p>「But that guy is reckless sometimes. Even so, just what in the world is going on in the commonwealth?」</p>
<p>Creare showed its motivation after seeing the two worrying like this.</p>
<p>『I understand. Then I’ll try investigating for a bit.』</p>
<p>Livia lifted up her face.</p>
<p>「You can do that Are-chan?」</p>
<p>『Leave it to me. I have sent a relay for communication to there. Though its performance isn’t good and Luxion won’t like it, so this will be more like hacking.』</p>
<p>Ange threw away the composure that she had maintained until now and jumped at that offer.</p>
<p>「I don’t care how you do it! Just do it immediately if you can check how Leon is doing there right now.」</p>
<p>『I will be able to obtain only fragmentary information though.』</p>
<p>「I don’t mind that. If Leon is safe then──」</p>
<p>Ange placed her hands on her chest and prayed for Leon’s safety. After seeing how anxious Ange was, Creare performed an unauthorized access into Luxion.</p>
<p>Creare’s blue lens emitted a blue glow.</p>
<p>『Then, I’m going to investigate for a bit. Err~, the position of Luxion’s main body right now is──』</p>
<p>Livia joined her hands together in a praying gesture.</p>
<p>「Leon-san──please be safe.」</p>
<p>Ange hugged Livia’s shoulder from the side.</p>
<p>「It will be fine. Leon is strong after all.」</p>
<p>Then──.</p>
<p>『──Hyaaaa!』</p>
<p>──Creare let out a strange voice.</p>
<p>Livia stood up.</p>
<p>「Are-chan, what’s wrong!?」</p>
<p>Ange grabbed Creare with both her hands.</p>
<p>Her eyes were very serious.</p>
<p>「What happened!? Is Leon safe!?」</p>
<p>Creare told the two the information that it had gathered.</p>
<p>『About that──I managed to obtain Luxion’s log. I could only obtain completely trivial information.』</p>
<p>「A, and!?」</p>
<p>Livia asked Creare to continue. Creare looked really hesitant to answer her.</p>
<p>It made the two even more anxious.</p>
<p>『That’s──I was able to confirm master’s safety. It looks like Luxion is also properly staying at master’s side. Ah, Marie-chan and others are also safe.』</p>
<p>Ange and Livia grasped each other’s hands with their palms pressed on each other.</p>
<p>They pressed their body together and their large breasts were flattened against each other.</p>
<p>「I see, so Leon is safe!」</p>
<p>「That’s great, Ange!」</p>
<p>They didn’t ask about Marie and others at all. They were simply relieved hearing that Leon was safe.</p>
<p>The two of them were smiling happily, but──.</p>
<p>『B-but you see. That’s──the place where master is staying right now──is in the same place where Marie and others are living in.』</p>
<p>Shadow appeared in the two’s smile.</p>
<p>Livia became concerned for Ange.</p>
<p>「Ange, surely there is a reason why they are living together.」</p>
<p>Ange’s cheeks were twitching.</p>
<p>「You’re right, there must be a reason. Perhaps the official there couldn’t obtain a place for Leon to stay separately from them. It must be that kind of reason. That must be how it is. If not, Leon staying in the same house with that woman is just──」</p>
<p>And then Creare told the two of them about another information it obtained from the log──some words that Luxion murmured.</p>
<p>『The information that I obtained is varied and fragmentary so it doesn’t form a clear picture but, I managed to pick up some words that Luxion murmured. Let’s see here──he once muttered “now in the middle of cheating”.』</p>
<p>The two’s expression and──the light in their eyes vanished from their face.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>This was a great ending to the novel. And I can just imagine Ange and Livia with light-lacking yandere eyes in that last scene. But I can also imagine them arriving, getting angry, various things happening, then the two of them having a heart-to-heart (knives excluded) with Noelle – then shocking Leon by telling him that they have decided to accept Noelle as wife 3.</p>
<p>Something just occurred to me. Leon looks almost exactly like the deceased Leon Rault, and now he also has a sacred crest on his hand. Won’t the people of the kingdom believe he really is Leon Rault because of this? Or does each family’s crest differ, in which case Leon’s crest may not match? And wouldn’t this cause a huge problem – possibly for both kingdoms? </p>
<p>On the other hand, if Louise truly believes Leon is her younger brother, that route should close rather quickly. But if this misunderstanding spreads I can see Louise becoming like Marie, a sort of pseudo-sister (in this life), even after it is disproven insisting on treating him (and being treated by him) as a sister.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>With this, then the main heroine of both game is now on his harem (temp). I can’t imagine Leon would accept himself to be chained by sacred tree in Alzer, hence.</p>
<p>I’m betting that he would f*cked up the plot again and destroy the sacred tree for good so his duty as a guardian can be thrown while giving him a freedom to bring the 3rd wive (tem) home.</p>
<p>Yep, yep, good for you Luxon. you f*ck Alzer and all its people later.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks again Pervert-san, You’re amazing as always!</p>
<p>Forget about the fate of Aizer or Sacred Tree problem, the most dangerous one is Leon’s life itself, i cant imagine what would Ange and Livia do later to Leon 😂, Even the hero would scared to his wives. </p>
<p>And it just me who hate that bit*hies attitude of Lelia? Is there something wrong in her head to throw all the responsibility to Leon? I know that what Leon did was one of the factor which cause this situation, but the one who did nothing and just happily life with a man when in the same time force her sister to just accept her fate to loving someone that she didnt like is… Whatever.</p>
<p>Last, is there any news about volume 5 release date? Please tell me if you know</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Actually, they are very related. They are both about people being reincarnated in “Otome games” and trying to survive in the new world.</p>
<p>The main differences are that Leon is a guy and Katarina is a gal, Leon is a mob while Katarina is a villainess, and that Otomege Isekai spun out so wildly but magnificently to shounen/seinen territory due to hardcore action and mechs while Hametsu Flag remained a shoujo comedy series for the most part of its story.</p>

<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks again Pervert-san, You’re amazing as always!</p>
<p>Forget about the fate of Aizer or Sacred Tree problem, the most dangerous one is Leon’s life itself, i cant imagine what would Ange and Livia do later to Leon 😂, Even the hero would scared to his wives.</p>
<p>And it just me who hate that bit*hies attitude of Lelia? Is there something wrong in her head to throw all the responsibility to Leon? I know that what Leon did was one of the factor which cause this situation, but the one who did nothing and just happily life with a man when in the same time force her sister to just accept her fate to loving someone that she didnt like is… Whatever.</p>
<p>Last, is there any news about volume 5 release date? Please tell me if you know</p>
